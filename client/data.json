Otherwise we will start leaking data as the old observable, which isn’t used any more, will still be producing results.\r\n  ngOnDestroy() { \r\n    if (this.subscription) {\r\n      this.subscription.unsubscribe();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat we are doing here is\r\n\r\n- We render the value of observableData in our template.\r\n- We create an observable which publishes out a number which increments by one every second then squares that number.\r\n- We subscribe to the output of this observable chain and store the number on the property observableData. We also store a reference to the subscription so we can unsubscribe to it later.\r\n- On destruction of the component we unsubscribe from the observable to avoid memory leaks.\r\n\r\n### By using AsyncPipe we don’t need to perform the subscribe and store any intermediate data on our component, like so:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: \"async-pipe\",\r\n    template: `\r\n        <div class=\"card card-block\">\r\n            <h4 class=\"card-title\">AsyncPipe</h4>\r\n            <p class=\"card-text\" ngNonBindable>{{ observable | async }}</p>\r\n            <p class=\"card-text\">{{ observable | async }}</p>\r\n            (1)\r\n        </div>\r\n    `\r\n})\r\nclass AsyncPipeComponent {\r\n    observable: Observable<number>;\r\n\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        this.observable = this.getObservable();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    getObservable() {\r\n        return Observable.interval(1000)\r\n            .take(10)\r\n            .map(v => v * v);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### We pipe our observable directly to the async pipe, it performs a subscription for us and then returns whatever gets passed to it.\r\n\r\nBy using AsyncPipe we:\r\n\r\n- 1. Don’t need to call subscribe on our observable and store the intermediate data on our component.\r\n- 2.Don't need to remember to unsubscribe from the observable when the component is destroyed.\r\n- 3. So less number of states variables\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://codecraft.tv/courses/angular/pipes/async-pipe/](https://codecraft.tv/courses/angular/pipes/async-pipe/)\r\n"

When a new value is emitted, the async pipe marks the component to be checked for changes. When the component gets destroyed, the async pipe unsubscribes automatically to avoid potential memory leaks.\r\n\r\nNormally to render the result of a promise or an observable we have to:\r\n\r\n- 1. Wait for a callback.\r\n\r\n- 2. Store the result of the callback in a variable.\r\n\r\n- 3. Bind to that variable in the template.\r\n\r\nWith AsyncPipe we can use promises and observables directly in our template, without having to store the result on an intermediate property or variable.\r\n\r\nAsyncPipe accepts as argument an observable or a promise, calls subcribe or attaches a then handler, then waits for the asynchronous result before passing it through to the caller.\r\n\r\n## Why use the async pipe ?\r\n\r\n#### Because it automatically subscribes and unsubscribes from Observables as the component gets instantiated or destroyed, which is a great feature.\r\n\r\n#### This is especially important in the case of long-lived observables like for example certain Observables returned by the router or by AngularFire.\r\n\r\n#### Also because it makes our programs easier to read and more declarative, with fewer state variables in our component classes.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://malcoded.com/posts/angular-async-pipe/](https://malcoded.com/posts/angular-async-pipe/)\r\n"

            "content": "Another use case to follow the best practice of **always use async pipe when possible and only use .subscribe when side effect is an absolute necessity.**\r\n\r\nAnother way to think about this is, side effects in logic are hard to maintain and how prematured .subscribe forces developers to make unecessary side effects.\r\n\r\n**Observable is an abstraction of asynchronous stream of data. For example, when we look at Observable<string>, it represents a stream of strings which will be delivered one by one over the time.Observable is an abstraction of asynchronous stream of data.**\r\n\r\n    Now why would we care?\r\n\r\nWe need to care because stream of data coming in an asynchronous fashion is extremely hard to think about. And it is even harder when multiple streams need to be combined. It becomes very error prone to code around it. To do such operations, we can use RxJS operators.\r\n\r\nRxJS operators, allow us to operate directly on observables, modifying , combining, aggregating, filtering data of observables.\r\n\r\nYou are safe as long as you stay in the Observable.\r\n\r\nWe must try to keep the observable as long as possible, combining it or modifying it using RxJS operators. As long as we stay within the observable, we do not need to think about the bigger picture.\r\nAll we need to think about is what to do with the single string we receive. We don’t need to care about the fact that we will receive multiple values over the time hence the safety. **The power of RxJS is that each operation is assured to receive the output of the previous operation as its own input.** This is an extremely powerful model which allows developers to easily follow the code logic making it predictable.\r\n\r\nBut if we keep the Observable modifying it around, how do we display data? This is where we have been used to **.subscribe**.\r\n\r\n#### Subscribe function\r\n\r\nWe pass the observable around, combining it, saving it to different variables with different combination of operators but at the end, an Observable<T> is useless on its own. We need a way to “terminate” the observale and extract the type T out of it. That is what .subscribe is used for. To subscribe to the resulting stream and terminate the observable.\r\n\r\nNow we could do the following:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n    expenses: Expense[];\r\n\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n    this.getExpenses()\r\n        .subscribe(expenses => {\r\n            this.expenses = expenses;\r\n        });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n   expenses: Expense[] = [];\r\nfilter = \"food\";\r\n\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n    this.getExpenses()\r\n        .subscribe(expenses => {\r\n            this.expenses = expenses.filter(e => e.type === this.filter);\r\n        });\r\n\r\n    this.getFilter()\r\n        .subscribe(filter => {\r\n            this.filter = filter;\r\n            this.expenses = this.expenses.filter(e => e.type === filter);\r\n        });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can already appreciate the benefit of only subscribing when necessary and using the RxJS combinators:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexpenses: Expense[] = [];\r\n\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n    this.getExpenses()\r\n        .combineLatest(this.getFilter())\r\n        .subscribe(([expenses, filter]) => {\r\n            this.expenses = expenses.filter(e => e.type === filter);\r\n        });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut as I said earlier, we are safe from asynchronousy as long as we stay in the observable therefore we can do even better and never actually use subscribe by using async pipe.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as it becomes more complex, like if we need to get a list of expense type to filter, it becomes hard to combine.\r\n\r\n#### Finaly the best solution is with Async Pipe\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the observable, we would transform it as such:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexpenses$: Observable<Expense[]>;\r\n\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n    this.expenses$ = this.getExpenses()\r\n        .combineLatest(this.getFilter())\r\n        .map(([expenses, filter]) => expenses.filter(e => e.type === filter));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe dollar \\$ is a convention to know that the variable is an observable. Then to display from the UI, we would need to use the async pipe.\r\n\r\n`{{ expenses$ | async }}`\r\n\r\nNow if I want to pass the `expenses` list as a state down to a Child, we want to remove the observable from Child component. So we want to make a binding using `[expenses]=\"{{ expenses$ | async }}\"` so that the Child component itself taking as @Input `expenses` will be without observable, and this Child component does not need to know anything about the way the Observable is arrived.\r\n\r\n#### Best practices\r\n\r\nTo summarize, those are the best practices to ensure validity of the logic:\r\n\r\n1. Prefer assignments rather than callbacks, assign Observable rather than subscription,\r\n2. Let the framework terminate the Observable\r\n3. Leverage the power of Angular components and Angular async pipe to code without asynchronousy,\r\n4. Use libraries like reselect, rxjs to manipulate observable,\r\n5. Make sure the external variables used inside the rx operators function are const.\r\n\r\n##### we should always use async pipe when possible and only use .subscribe when side effect is an absolute necessity as we are safe as long as we stay in the observable. The code terminating the observable should be the framework (Angular) and the last piece (the UI).\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.com/2018/05/async-pipe-versus-subscribe-in-angular.html](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.com/2018/05/async-pipe-versus-subscribe-in-angular.html)\r\n"

            "content": "#### What Is ContentChildren?\r\n\r\nContentChildren is a parameter decorator that is used to fetch the QueryList of elements or directives from the content DOM. The QueryList is updated whenever the child element/component is added or removed.\r\n\r\nThe child element reference is set in QueryList just before the ngAfterContentInit lifecycle Hook method.\r\n\r\n**Below, we are using the ContentChildren to get the QueryList containing the list of the child component ChildComp. The list is stored in the contentChildren variable in the Parent component.**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@ContentChildren(ChildComp) contentChildren : QueryList<ChildComp>;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet’s see an example that utilizes the power of ContentChildren…\r\nWe are creating a child component `TabComponent` with an input property object `tab` and a function that prints the title property of the tab object. The template just displays the properties.\r\n\r\nComponent hierarchy is as below\r\n\r\n```\r\n--- AppComponent\r\n  --- TabListComponent\r\n      --- TabComponent\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component, Input } from \"@angular/core\"\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"app-tab\",\r\n  template: `<h4>{{ tab.title }}</h4>\r\n    <p>{{ tab.content }}</p>`,\r\n})\r\nexport class TabComponent {\r\n  @Input() tab: object\r\n  printTitle() {\r\n    console.log(this.tab.title)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow **TabListComponent**\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport {\r\n  ContentChildren,\r\n  QueryList,\r\n  Component,\r\n  AfterContentInit,\r\n} from \"@angular/core\"\r\nimport { TabComponent } from \"./tab.component\"\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"app-tab-list\",\r\n  template: `<ng-content></ng-content>`,\r\n})\r\nexport class TabListComponent implements AfterContentInit {\r\n  @ContentChildren(TabComponent) tabList: QueryList<TabComponent>\r\n  ngAfterContentInit() {\r\n    this.tabList.toArray()[0].printTitle()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTabListComponent is the parent component where we are accessing the child component TabComponent list from the content DOM using the ContentChildren decorator.\r\n\r\nAs the child element references are set in QueryList just before the ngAfterContentInit callback, we are accessing the QueryList in the ngAfterContentInit lifecycle Hook.\r\n\r\nIn the template, we are using the ng-content directive which projects the elements in between the <app-tab-list><app-tab-list> tag to the component’s view.\r\n\r\nThe elements added between the selector element are said to be content-projected elements and are accessible by ContentChildren.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, we are able to access the child component method (`**printTitle**`) from the parent component (as shown in the **ngAfterContentInit** method).\r\n\r\n**Finally, this is the top view component with the above two selectors in its template.**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Component, Input, OnInit } from \"@angular/core\"\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"app-root\",\r\n  template: ` <app-tab-list>\r\n    <app-tab *ngFor=\"let tab of tabs\" [tab]=\"tab\"></app-tab>\r\n  </app-tab-list>`,\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  tabs = []\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    this.tabs = [\r\n      { title: \"First Tab title\", content: \"First Tab content\" },\r\n      { title: \"Second Tab title\", content: \"Second Tab content\" },\r\n      { title: \"Third Tab title\", content: \"Third Tab content\" },\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note: If we have a single child content element then we can use ContentChild instead of ContentChildren.**\r\n"

            "content": "What are decorators?\r\n[docs.angularjs.org/guide/decorators](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/decorators)\r\n\r\nDecorators are a design pattern that is used to separate modification or decoration of a class without modifying the original source code. In Angular, decorators are functions that allow a service, directive or filter to be modified prior to its usage.\r\n\r\nIn angular you create classes for everything, be it components, services, directives, etc.\r\n\r\nSo, how does angular compiler compiles your code and transforms it into ready-to-be-run scripts in browser?\r\n\r\nThis happens because of decorators. In simple term, decorators allows you to attach meta data with the typescript class using which angular knows whether that class is a component or directive or module or etc.\r\n\r\nNormally prefixed with an ‘@’\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./decorators.webp\">\r\n\r\nAs a design pattern decorator :\r\n\r\nAttaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically\r\nOffers flexible alternative to sub-classing for extending functionality\r\n\r\n**There are four main types of decorators:**\r\n\r\n**Class decorators**, e.g. @Component and @NgModule\r\n\r\n**Property decorators** for properties inside classes, e.g. @Input and @Output\r\n\r\n**Method decorators** for methods inside classes, e.g. @HostListener\r\n\r\n**Parameter decorators** for parameters inside class constructors, e.g. @Inject\r\n**@ContentChildren** is also a parameter decorator that is used to fetch the QueryList of elements or directives from the content DOM. The QueryList is updated whenever the child element/component is added or removed.\r\n\r\nNotice the () on **@Component** which is a Class Decorators. This means that the @Component is called once JavaScript encounters @Component(). In turn, this means that there must be a Component function somewhere that returns a function matching one of the decorator signatures outlined above. This is an example of the decorator factory pattern.\r\n\r\n[ultimatecourses.com/blog/angular-decorators](https://ultimatecourses.com/blog/angular-decorators)\r\n\r\n**Class Decorators**\r\n\r\nAngular offers us a few class decorators. These are the top-level decorators that we use to express intent for classes. They allow us to tell Angular that a particular class is a component, or module, for example. And the decorator allows us to define this intent without having to actually put any code inside the class.\r\n\r\nA @Component and @NgModule decorator example with classes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { NgModule, Component } from \"@angular/core\"\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"example-component\",\r\n  template: \"<div>Woo a component!</div>\",\r\n})\r\nexport class ExampleComponent {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    console.log(\"Hey I am a component!\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [],\r\n  declarations: [],\r\n})\r\nexport class ExampleModule {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    console.log(\"Hey I am a module!\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how both classes by themselves are effectively the same. No code is needed within the class to tell Angular that it is a component or a module. All we need to do is decorate it, and Angular will do the rest.\r\n\r\n**Here’s the list of decorators available in Angular:**\r\n\r\n@NgModule\r\n@Component\r\n@Injectable\r\n@Directive\r\n@Pipe\r\n@Input\r\n@Output\r\n@HostBinding\r\n@HostListener\r\n@ContentChild\r\n@ContentChildren\r\n@ViewChild\r\n@ViewChildren\r\n\r\n### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[list-of-all-decorators-available-in-angular-71bdf4ad6976](https://medium.com/@madhavmahesh/list-of-all-decorators-available-in-angular-71bdf4ad6976)\r\n"

The property decorator is declared before the property declaration. It cannot be used in a declaration file or used in combination with a declare statement. The property decorators can change the value that comes out of the class properties.**\r\n\r\n#### How To Create a Property Decorator\r\n\r\nWhen you create a property decorator function, you need to have two arguments.\r\n\r\n**target, which refers to the constructor or prototype of the class you’re using the decorator on.**\r\n\r\n**key, which refers to the class property you’re using the decorator on.When using target[key], you will get the value (of that instance of the class) inside the property. This is super useful!**\r\n\r\nThe Class decorator function has no access to any property value. That’s why the class decorator is better for adding properties. It’s not so useful for modifying property values. It is possible but introduces side effects.\r\n\r\n#### Then you also need following\r\n\r\n**Getter**\r\nThe getter function is for getting the property value of the class where you used the property decorator. Inside this function, we have access to the instance of the class. In the return statement, we return the label, which includes the value of that property.\r\n\r\n**defineProperty**\r\n\r\nFinally, we have an accessor descriptor **Object.defineProperty()** in the property decorator.\r\n\r\nAccording to MDN web docs, **“An accessor descriptor is a property described by a getter-setter pair of functions.”**\r\n\r\nThis descriptor will describe how our property will behave inside a class.\r\n\r\nInside the descriptor, we can have a getter and setter method. They will be executed when you want to get the value or change (i.e. set) it.\r\n\r\nThe static method **Object.defineProperty()** defines a new property directly on an object, or modifies an existing property on an object, and returns the object.\r\n\r\n#### Syntax - Object.defineProperty(obj, prop, descriptor)\r\n\r\n**obj** - The object on which to define the property.\r\n\r\n**prop** - The name or Symbol of the property to be defined or modified.\r\n\r\n**descriptor** - The descriptor for the property being defined or modified.\r\n\r\nA type script example\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction Override(label: string) {\r\n  return function (target: any, key: string) {\r\n    Object.defineProperty(target, key, {\r\n      configurable: false,\r\n      get: () => label,\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Test {\r\n  @Override(\"test\") // invokes Override, which returns the decorator\r\n  name: string = \"pat\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet t = new Test()\r\nconsole.log(t.name) // 'test'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above example must be compiled with both the --experimentalDecorators and --emitDecoratorMetadata flags.\r\n\r\nIn this case the decorated property is replaced by the label passed to the decorator. It's important to note that property values cannot be directly manipulated by the decorator; instead an accessor is used.\r\nHere's a classic property example that uses a plain decorator\r\n\r\nHere's a classic property example that uses a plain decorator\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction ReadOnly(target: any, key: string) {\r\n  Object.defineProperty(target, key, { writable: false })\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Test {\r\n  @ReadOnly // notice there are no `()`\r\n  name: string\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst t = new Test()\r\nt.name = \"jan\"\r\nconsole.log(t.name) // 'undefined'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the name property is not writable, and remains undefined.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/features/typescript/property_decorators](https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/features/typescript/property_decorators)\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/better-programming/an-introduction-to-typescript-property-decorators-1c9db23b6ca1](https://medium.com/better-programming/an-introduction-to-typescript-property-decorators-1c9db23b6ca1)\r\n"

Inside this function, we have access to the instance of the class. In the return statement, we return the label, which includes the value of that property.\r\n\r\n**defineProperty**\r\n\r\nFinally, we have an accessor descriptor **Object.defineProperty()** in the property decorator.\r\n\r\nAccording to MDN web docs, **“An accessor descriptor is a property described by a getter-setter pair of functions.”**\r\n\r\nThis descriptor will describe how our property will behave inside a class.\r\n\r\nInside the descriptor, we can have a getter and setter method.

In this case, I didn’t change it but added an emoji to it.\r\nWhen we try to add the emoji there, which sounds very logical to me, we would get an error. This is because we don't have access to the whole instance of the class in the setter.\r\n\r\nInside the descriptor, we have a getter and setter method. They will be executed when you want to get the value or change it. Next to that, we set the enumerable to true. This will make sure it's visible during the enumeration of the corresponding object.\r\nAccording to MDN web docs, “An accessor descriptor is a property described by a getter-setter pair of functions.”\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/better-programming/an-introduction-to-typescript-property-decorators-1c9db23b6ca1](https://medium.com/better-programming/an-introduction-to-typescript-property-decorators-1c9db23b6ca1)\r\n"

            "content": "### TemplateRef\r\n\r\nThe notion of a template should be familiar for most web developers. It’s a group of DOM elements that are reused in views across the application. Before the HTML5 standard introduced the template tag, most templates arrived to the browser wrapped in a script tag with some variation of the type attribute:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script id=\"tpl\" type=\"text/template\">\r\n  <span>I am span in template</span>\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach certainly had many drawbacks like the semantics and the necessity to manually create DOM models. With the template tag a browser parses html and creates a DOM tree but doesn't render it. It can then be accessed through the content property:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  let tpl = document.querySelector(\"#tpl\")\r\n  let container = document.querySelector(\".insert-after-me\")\r\n  insertAfter(container, tpl.content)\r\n</script>\r\n<div class=\"insert-after-me\"></div>\r\n<ng-template id=\"tpl\">\r\n  <span>I am span in template</span>\r\n</ng-template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAngular embraces this approach and implements TemplateRef class to work with a template. Here is how it can be used:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"sample\",\r\n  template: `<ng-template #tpl>\r\n    <span>I am span in template</span>\r\n  </ng-template>`,\r\n})\r\n\r\n\r\nexport class SampleComponent implements AfterViewInit {\r\n  @ViewChild(\"tpl\") tpl: TemplateRef<any>\r\n\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    let elementRef = this.tpl.elementRef\r\n    // outputs `template bindings={}`\r\n    console.log(elementRef.nativeElement.textContent)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe framework removes the template element from the DOM and inserts a comment in its place. This is how it looks when rendered:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<sample>\r\n  <!--template bindings={}-->\r\n</sample>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy itself the **TemplateRef** class is a simple class. It holds a reference to its host element in the **elementRef** property and has one method: **createEmbeddedView**.\r\n\r\nHowever, this method is very useful since it allows us to create a view and return a reference to it as **ViewRef**.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://indepth.dev/exploring-angular-dom-manipulation-techniques-using-viewcontainerref/](https://indepth.dev/exploring-angular-dom-manipulation-techniques-using-viewcontainerref/)\r\n"

So this 'defaultTabButtons\" acts as a hook to grab thinks inside `ng-template`\r\n\r\nAs we can see, the template can be injected just like any other DOM element or component, by providing the template reference name defaultTabButtons to the ViewChild decorator.\r\n\r\nThis means that templates are accessible also at the level of the component class, and we can do things such as for example pass them to child components!\r\n\r\nAn example of why we would want to do that is to create a more customizable component, where can pass to it not only a configuration parameter or configuration object: we can also pass a template as an input parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Important \r\nSometime, we need to be able to access the code that is grabbed by the `ViewChild`.

            "content": "The** @ViewChild** and** @ViewChildren** decorators in Angular provide a way to access and manipulate DOM elements, directives and components. In this tutorial, we'll see an Angular 9 example of how to use the two decorators.\r\n\r\n**You can use ViewChild if you need to query one element from the DOM and ViewChildren for multiple elements. In other words, they behave the same, only the former returns one reference, while the latter returns multiple references as a QueryList object.**\r\n\r\n**Usually, these decorators are paired with template reference variables. A template reference variable is simply a named reference to a DOM element within a template. You can view it as something similar to the id attribute of an html element. You mark a DOM element with a template reference and then query it inside a class using the ViewChild decorator.**\r\n\r\n#### What's ViewChild in Angular?\r\n\r\n**ViewChild** is a decorator that creates a view or DOM query. According to the docs\r\n\r\nProperty decorator that configures a view query. The change detector looks for the first element or the directive matching the selector in the view DOM. If the view DOM changes, and a new child matches the selector, the property is updated.\r\n\r\nThe decorator takes the following meta information:\r\n\r\n**selector** - the selector of the element to query. This can be a directive type or a name.\r\n**read** - read a different token from the queried elements.\r\n**static** - This is new in Angular 8 and indicates whether or not to resolve query results before change detection runs.\r\n\r\nViewChild can take the following selectors:\r\n\r\n- Classes with the @Component or @Directive decorators i.e components and directives,\r\n- Template reference variables,\r\n- Providers,\r\n- TemplateRef\r\n\r\nNow, let's assume in my src/app/app.component.ts file I am doing the query of the child component using ViewChild.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Component, ViewChild, AfterViewInit } from \"@angular/core\"\r\n\r\nimport { HelloComponent } from \"./hello.component\"\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"my-app\",\r\n  templateUrl: \"./app.component.html\",\r\n  styleUrls: [\"./app.component.css\"],\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent implements AfterViewInit {\r\n  name = \"Angular\"\r\n  @ViewChild(HelloComponent, { static: false }) hello: HelloComponent\r\n\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    console.log(\"Hello \", this.hello.name)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow in the console (browser dev-tool), you should get `Hello Angular`:\r\n\r\nNow, let's explain the code.\r\n\r\nFirst, we imported HelloComponent and ViewChild and AfterViewInit from the @angular/core package:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Component, ViewChild, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { HelloComponent } from './hello.component';\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we create a query called hello that takes HelloComponent as the selector and has static equals to false:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@ViewChild(HelloComponent, {static: false}) hello: HelloComponent;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Angular 9, timing for ContentChild and ViewChild needs to be specified explicitly.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know, [​Why do I have to specify {static: false}? Isn't that the default?](https://angular.io/guide/static-query-migration#why-do-i-have-to-specify-static-false-isnt-that-the-default)\r\n\r\nNext, in the ngAfterViewInit() life-cycle hook, we can use the query to access the DOM element for the hello component. In our example, we accessed the name property of the component, after it's mounted in the DOM, which contains the Angular string:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    console.log('Hello ', this.hello.name);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can access any properties and even methods from the queried component.\r\n"

This hook is only once called in its lifetime after the **first ngOnChanges** .\r\n\r\n**ngDoCheck** : It is invoked whenever the change detector of the given component is called. This allows you to implement your own change detection algorithm for the provided component.\r\n\r\n**ngOnDestroy** : It is invoked right before the component is destroyed by Angular. You can use this hook in order to unsubscribe observables and detach event handlers for avoiding any kind of memory leaks.\r\n\r\n#### Difference between ngOnChanges and ngOnInit\r\n\r\n**ngOnInit()** is used to execute any piece of code for **ONLY ONE TIME** (for eg : data fetch on load).\r\n\r\n**ngOnChanges()** will execute on every **@Input()** property change.\r\n\r\nIf you want to execute any component method, based on the @Input() value change, then you should write such logic inside ngOnChanges().\r\n\r\n**So why do we need ngOnInit() when we have ngOnChanges() ?**\r\n\r\nIt is because you cannot execute one time code, on every @Input() property change. And you cannot use constructor as the replacement of ngOnInit() as well. Because the bindings, such as **@Input** properties are not available within the constructor.\r\n\r\n**ngOnChanges** will be called first on the life cycle hook when there is a change to the component inputs through the parent.\r\n\r\n**ngOnInit** will be called only once on initializing the component after the first ngOnChanges called.\r\n\r\n#### Why is ngOnInit not the first lifecycle hook?\r\n\r\n**ngOnInit()** is called after **ngOnChanges**() was called the first time.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that initial values bound to inputs are available when ngOnInit() is called. ngOnChanges() is called after inputs were updated.\r\n"

Angular calls this constructor injection pattern.\r\n\r\nThe Constructor is a default method of the class that is executed when the class is instantiated and ensures proper initialisation of fields in the class and its subclasses. It has nothing to do with Angular2.\r\nAngular, or better Dependency Injector (DI), analyses the constructor parameters and when it creates a new instance by calling new MyClass() it tries to find providers that match the types of the constructor parameters, resolves them and passes them to the constructor\r\n\r\n### NgOnInit\r\n\r\n- **ngOnChanges is called when an @Input or output binding value changes**\r\n- **ngOnInit is called after the first ngOnChanges**\r\n\r\n#### Now when does `ngOnChanges` is called\r\n\r\n[angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks)\r\n\r\nRespond when Angular (re)sets data-bound input properties. The method receives a SimpleChanges object of current and previous property values. Called before ngOnInit() and whenever one or more data-bound input properties change.\r\n\r\nWhen Angular calls **ngOnInit** it has finished creating a component DOM, injected all required dependencies through constructor and processed input bindings. And all of the class members has been defined. So here you have all the required information available which makes it a good place to perform initialization logic.\r\n\r\nIt’s a common practice to use `ngOnInit` to perform initialization logic even if this logic doesn’t depend on DI, DOM or input bindings.\r\n\r\nMostly we use **ngOnInit** for all the initialization/declaration and avoid stuff to work in the constructor. The constructor should only be used to initialize class members but shouldn't do actual \"work\".\r\n\r\nSo you should use constructor() to setup Dependency Injection and not much else. ngOnInit() is better place to \"start\" - it's where/when components' bindings are resolved.\r\n\r\n**[angular.io/api/core/OnInit](https://angular.io/api/core/OnInit)**\r\n\r\nngOnInit()\r\n\r\nA callback method that is invoked immediately after the default change detector has checked the directive's data-bound properties for the first time, and before any of the view or content children have been checked. It is invoked only once when the directive is instantiated.s\r\n\r\nLet’s put it all together and see them both in action:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {Component, OnInit} from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n                  constructor(myService: MyService) {\r\n                  //Let’s assume this will return an array of samples [‘sample 1’, ‘sample 2’, ‘sample 3’]\r\n                  this.samples = myService.getSamples();\r\n                  this.sentence = ‘Number of samples: ’;\r\n  }\r\n\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  this.countSamples();\r\n}\r\n\r\ncountSamples() {\r\n  //Result will be ‘Number of samples: 3’\r\n         this.sentence = this.sentence + this.samples.length;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example we are injecting the dependency myService. You should not confuse this with MyService (note the uppercase ‘M’) which is the type of the service. Then we are calling the method myService.getSamples() which will resolve with an array. In our ngOnInit() method we call the function this.countSamples() which is able to work with the (already initialized and resolved) fields this.samples and this.sentence. We can see that countSamples() simply appends the length of this.samples to the string this.sentence.\r\n\r\n#### Lastly take a look at the comparison between lifecycle hooks between React and Angular\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./lifecycle-methods-ng-and-react.png\">\r\n"

This is why @ViewChild() depends on it. You can't access view members before they are rendered.\r\n\r\nWhen I say rendered - It means, it's added to the DOM.

But if you investigate the DOM using the browsers devtools, you'll be able to see the markup.\r\n\r\n**ngAfterViewInit()** is called after a component's view, and its children's views, are created.

The word \"check\" here used in the sense of **change-detection**\r\n\r\nLets see and example\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Component, OnInit, DoCheck, AfterViewInit } from \"@angular/core\";\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"app-home\",\r\n  template: `<a (click)=\"clickMe()\">Click me</a>`,\r\n  styleUrls: [\"./home.component.css\"]\r\n})\r\nexport class HomeComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  constructor() {}\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    console.log(\"onInit called\");\r\n  }\r\n  ngDoCheck() {\r\n    console.log(\"do check\");\r\n  }\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    console.log(\"after view init\");\r\n  }\r\n  clickMe() {\r\n    console.log(\"link clicked\");\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, **ngAfterViewInit()** gets called one time after **ngDoCheck**.\r\n\r\nTriggering the clickMe() function WILL NOT trigger ngAfterViewInit().\r\n\r\nRemember from [official doc](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks#lifecycle-sequence) -\r\n\r\n**ngDoCheck()** - Detect and act upon changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own.\r\n\r\nCalled during every change detection run, immediately after ngOnChanges() and ngOnInit().\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks#component-lifecycle-hooks-overview](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks#component-lifecycle-hooks-overview)\r\n"

            "content": "**ngOnChanges** runs whenever any of the inputs change, if you use setter/getters for the inputs you want to listen to they will only run when that input is being changed.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to subscribing to property changes in Angular, I think most people would immediately think of **ngOnChanges** lifecycle hook. A typical example looks like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {\r\n  if (changes.key1) {\r\n      console.log(`key1 is changed from ${changes.key1.previousValue} to ${changes.key1.currentValue}`);\r\n  }\r\n  if (changes.key2) {\r\n    console.log(`key2 is changed from ${changes.key2.previousValue} to ${changes.key2.currentValue}`);\r\n  }\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne advantage of ngOnChanges() is that you get all changes at once if your component has several @Input()s.\r\n\r\nIf your code only depends on a single @Input() a setter is probably the better approach.\r\n\r\nNow **ngOnChanges** has the following issues:\r\n\r\nIt combines change detection of ALL input properties into one ngOnChanges hook function. And then we need to separate those properties with an if statement making it less readable especially when there are many properties to be watched.\r\n\r\nThe interface of SimpleChanges accepts any string as its key, making it possible for typos. For example, changes.typo_key will not be complained about by the TypeScript compiler.\r\n\r\nSimpleChange.previousValue and SimpleChange.currentValue are typed to any instead of the desired property type.\r\n\r\nSo a common alternative to **ngOnChanges**, which is to use a setter function. It looks like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n    private _title: string;\r\n\r\n    @Input()\r\n    set title(value: string) {\r\n        this._title = value;\r\n        console.log(`title is changed to ${value}`);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    get title(): string {\r\n        return this._title;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the common patter to replace **ngOnChanges** with setter function is following\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n @Input()\r\n  set someInput( val ) {\r\n    this.runSomething();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnChanges(changes) {\r\n     this.runSomething();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdvantages -\r\nThis decouples the different properties. The setter function (on-change hook) is located together with @Input() for better readability.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I only use this method when there are multiple inputs that are all used together in a synchronous computation. If there are multiple inputs that are independently used, then the use of ngOnChanges requires you to explicitly check which properties were changed, since it is invoked for every input property change. This quickly makes the use of the ngOnChanges method unergonomic.\r\n\r\nSo for single Input changes, Responding to input changes with property accessor functions, is a better way\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass MyComponent {\r\n    public parts: string[] = [];\r\n    @Input() public set name(value: string) {\r\n        this.parts = value.split(\" \");\r\n    }\r\n    public get name(): string {\r\n        return this.parts.join(\" \");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this can be made less verbose by omitting the getter function. This is possible because you are often only interested in the derived value that is computed in the setter function rather than the original input value.\r\n\r\nThe property accessor function approach works best if you have multiple input properties which are not tied together to compute a derived value from these inputs.\r\n"

When you subscribe you start with the most recent value and only see future changes.\r\n\r\nAnother way to think of this - An Observable is called a “cold” Observable if it does not begin to emit items until an observer has subscribed to it; an Observable is called a “hot” Observable if it may begin emitting items at any time, and a subscriber may begin observing the sequence of emitted items at some point after its commencement, missing out on any items emitted previously to the time of the subscription.\r\n\r\n#### Cold Observable Example\r\n\r\nWe know an Observable is cold if we subscribe at the same time, but get a different value.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst cold = Rx.Observable.create((observer) => {\r\n  observer.next(Math.random())\r\n})\r\n\r\ncold.subscribe((a) => console.log(`Subscriber A: ${a}`))\r\ncold.subscribe((b) => console.log(`Subscriber B: ${b}`))\r\n\r\n// Subscriber A: 0.2298339030\r\n// Subscriber B: 0.9720023832\r\n```\r\n\r\nThey both subscribed to the same Observable with different results. This happens because the cold Observable doesn’t generate the random number until after the subscription starts.\r\n\r\n#### Hot Observable Example\r\n\r\nA hot observable gets its values from an outside source. We can make it hot by simply moving the random number outside of the observable creation function.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst x = Math.random()\r\n\r\nconst hot = Rx.Observable.create((observer) => {\r\n  observer.next(x)\r\n})\r\n\r\nhot.subscribe((a) => console.log(`Subscriber A: ${a}`))\r\nhot.subscribe((b) => console.log(`Subscriber B: ${b}`))\r\n// Subscriber A: 0.312580103\r\n// Subscriber B: 0.312580103\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut how do we make an already cold observable hot? We can make a cold Observable hot by simply calling publish() on it. This will allow the subscribers to share the same values in realtime. To make it start emitting values, you call connect() after the subscription has started.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst cold = Rx.Observable.create((observer) => {\r\n  observer.next(Math.random())\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst hot = cold.publish()\r\n\r\nhot.subscribe((a) => console.log(`Subscriber A: {a}`))\r\nhot.subscribe((b) => console.log(`Subscriber B: {b}`))\r\n\r\nhot.connect()\r\n\r\n/// Subscriber A: 0.7122882102\r\n/// Subscriber B: 0.7122882102\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://fireship.io/lessons/rxjs-basic-pro-tips/](https://fireship.io/lessons/rxjs-basic-pro-tips/)\r\n"

            "content": "Observable isn’t an Angular specific feature, but a new standard for managing async data that will be included in the ES7 release. Angular uses observables extensively in the event system and the HTTP service.\r\n\r\n**Most simply, **observables** are lazy collections of multiple values over time. Instead of thinking about it as a singular event or piece of data that we use at a single point in time, it should be thought about as a collection of events or pieces of data over a period of time. \"A stream is a sequence of data elements made available over time\".**\r\n\r\n#### Observable is an abstraction of asynchronous stream of data. For example, when we look at Observable<string>, it represents a stream of strings which will be delivered one by one over the time.\r\n\r\n**If you are used to utilizing promises or something more obscure you will most likely implement code that is only run once and then succeed or fail. Observables, on the other hand, are data streams. They can keep emitting values and any subscriptions will receive and process them separately at the time they each arrive.**\r\n\r\nObservables are declarative—that is, you define a function for publishing values, but it is not executed until a consumer subscribes to it. The subscribed consumer then receives notifications until the function completes, or until they unsubscribe.\r\n\r\n**Observables are lazy**\r\n\r\nYou could think of lazy observables as newsletters. For each subscriber a new newsletter is created. They are then only send to those people, and not to anyone else.\r\n\r\n**Observables can have multiple values over time**\r\n\r\nNow if you keep that subscription to the newsletter open, you will get a new one every once and a while. The sender decides when you get it but all you have to do is just wait until it comes straight into your inbox.\r\n\r\n### Comparison with Promise\r\n\r\nIf you come from the world of promises this is a key difference as promises always return only one value. Another thing is that observables are cancelable. If you don’t want your newsletter anymore, you unsubscribe. With promises this is different, you can’t cancel a promise. If the promise is handed to you, the process that will produce that promise’s resolution is already underway, and you generally don’t have access to prevent that promise’s resolution from executing.\r\n\r\n### Push vs pull\r\n\r\nA key thing to understand when using observables is that observables push. Push and pull are two different ways that describe how a data producer communicates with the data consumer.\r\n\r\n### Pull\r\n\r\nWhen pulling, the data consumer decides when it get’s data from the data producer. The producer is unaware of when data will be delivered to the consumer.\r\nEvery javascript function uses the pull. The function is a Producer of data, and the code that calls the function is consuming it by “pulling” out a single return value from its call.\r\n\r\n### Push\r\n\r\nWhen pushing, it works the other way around. The data producer (the creator of the newsletter) decides when the consumer (the subscriber to the newsletter) gets the data.\r\nPromises are the most common way of push in JavaScript today. A promise (the producer) delivers a resolved value to registered callbacks (the consumers), but unlike functions, it is the promise which is in charge of determining precisely when that value is “pushed” to the callbacks.\r\nObservables are a new way of pushing data in JavaScript. An observable is a Producer of multiple values, “pushing” them to subscribers.\r\n\r\n### Observables in Angular\r\n\r\nIf you start using Angular you will probably encounter observables when setting up your HTTP requests. So let’s start there.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Observable } from \"rxjs/Rx\"\r\nimport { Injectable } from \"@angular/core\"\r\nimport { Http, Response } from \"@angular/http\"\r\n\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class HttpClient {\r\n\r\n    constructor(\r\n        public http: Http\r\n    ) {}\r\n\r\n    public fetchUsers() {\r\n        return this.http.get(\"/api/users\").map((res: Response) => res.json())\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have now created a simple HttpClient with a fetchUsers method that returns an observable. We probably like to display the users in some sort of list, so let’s do something with this method. Since this method returns an observable we have to subscribe to it. In Angular we can subscribe to an observable in two ways:\r\nManner 1:\r\n\r\nWe subscribe to an observable in our template using the async pipe. The benefit of this is that Angular deals with your subscription during the lifecycle of a component. Angular will automatically subscribe and unsubscribe for you. Don’t forget to import the “CommonModule” into your module, as the async pipe will be exposed from that.\r\n\r\n**component.ts**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\"\r\nimport { Observable } from \"rxjs/Rx\"\r\n\r\n// client\r\nimport { HttpClient } from \"../services/client\"\r\n\r\n// interface\r\nimport { IUser } from \"../services/interfaces\"\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: \"user-list\",\r\n    templateUrl:  \"./template.html\",\r\n})\r\nexport class UserList {\r\n\r\n    public users$: Observable<IUser[]>\r\n\r\n    constructor(\r\n        public client: HttpClient,\r\n    ) {}\r\n\r\n    // do a call to fetch the users on init of component\r\n    // the fetchUsers method returns an observable\r\n    // which we assign to the users$ property of our class\r\n    public ngOnInit() {\r\n        this.users$ = this.client.fetchUsers()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the corresponding template, where I am using the pipe (\"|\") and async to subscribe to the Observable.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- We use the async pipe to automatically subscribe/unsubscribe to our observable -->\r\n<ul class=\"user__list\" *ngIf=\"(users$ | async).length\">\r\n    <li class=\"user\" *ngFor=\"let user of users$ | async\">\r\n        {{ user.name }} - {{ user.birth_date }}\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note the dollar sign. Using the dollar sign in the name of a variable that is an observable, is considered best practice. This way it’s easy to identify if your variable is an observable or not.**\r\n\r\n## Key Points about Observables\r\n\r\n-   1. Observables are not executed until a consumer subscribes. The subscribe() executes the defined behavior once, and it can be called again. Each subscription has its own computation. Resubscription causes recomputation of values.\r\n\r\n### Manner 2:\r\n\r\nWe subscribe to the observable ourselves using the actual subscribe() method. This can be handy if you would first like to do something with the data before displaying it. The downside is that you have to manage the subscription yourself.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\"\r\n\r\n// client\r\nimport { HttpClient } from \"../services/client\"\r\n\r\n// interface\r\nimport { IUser } from \"../services/interfaces\"\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: \"user-list\",\r\n    templateUrl:  \"./template.html\",\r\n})\r\nexport class UserList {\r\n\r\n    public users: IUser[]\r\n\r\n    constructor(\r\n        public client: HttpClient,\r\n    ) {}\r\n\r\n    // do a call to fetch the users on init of component\r\n    // we manually subscribe to this method and take the users\r\n    // in our callback\r\n    public ngOnInit() {\r\n        this.client.fetchUsers().subscribe((users: IUser[]) => {\r\n\r\n            // do stuff with our data here.\r\n            // ....\r\n\r\n            // asign data to our class property in the end\r\n            // so it will be available to our template\r\n            this.users = users\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then the template\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ul class=\"user__list\" *ngIf=\"users.length\">\r\n    <li class=\"user\" *ngFor=\"let user of users\">\r\n        {{ user.name }} - {{ user.birth_date }}\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see the template logic is quite similar, the component logic can actually become much different and more complex if you go for manner 2. In general, for simple projects and component, I would recommend to choose manner 1. As this is the most easy and you don’t have to manually manage your subscriptions. **Keeping your subscriptions open while not using them is a memory leak and therefore not good.**\r\n\r\n### Creating an observable yourself\r\n\r\nNow that you know how to deal with common observables that are given to you by Angular, it’s good to know how you create an observable yourself. The simplest version looks like this:\r\n\r\nObservable.ts\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Observable } from \"rxjs/Observable\";\r\n\r\n// create observable\r\nconst simpleObservable = new Observable(observer => {\r\n    // observable execution\r\n    observer.next(\"bla bla bla\");\r\n    observer.complete();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// subscribe to the observable\r\nsimpleObservable.subscribe();\r\n\r\n// dispose the observable\r\nsimpleObservable.unsubscribe();\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### It would be better to handle the subscription in the parent component itself:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// GOOD\r\n// app.component.ts\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'app',\r\n    template: `\r\n        <user-detail [user]=\"user$|async\"></user-detail>\r\n    `\r\n})\r\nclass AppComponent implements OnInit {\r\n    users$: Observable<User[]> = this.http.get(...);\r\n    user: User;\r\n    ngOnInit(){\r\n        // the app component (smart) subscribes to the user$ which will\r\n        // do an XHR call here\r\n        this.users$ = this.http.get(...);\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// user-detail.component.ts\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'user-detail',\r\n    template: `\r\n\r\n    `\r\n})\r\nclass UserDetailComponent {\r\n    // This component doesn't even know that we are using RxJS which\r\n    // results in better decoupling\r\n    @Input() user: User;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of the component is clear. The user-detail is meant to be dumb and is completely decoupled from its parent.\r\n\r\nThere are however situations where we would like to create a stream from an input. In that case we could take a look at this library: ngx-reactivetoolkit\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n1.

It takes a projection function (here its the extractData function), and applies it to each value that comes from the source observable.\r\n"

It's a method that comes from rxjs library which Angular is using internally.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44921788/what-is-subscribe-in-angular/51935993)**\r\n\r\n[Source Doc](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/index/class/Observable#subscribe-)\r\n\r\n[reactivex.io/documentation/operators/subscribe.html](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/subscribe.html)\r\nA typical implementation of the Subscribe operator may accept one to three methods (which then constitute the observer), or it may accept an object (sometimes called an Observer or Subscriber) that implements the interface which includes those three methods:\r\n\r\n**onNext**\r\n\r\nAn Observable calls this method whenever the Observable emits an item. This method takes as a parameter the item emitted by the Observable.\r\n\r\n**onError**\r\n\r\nAn Observable calls this method to indicate that it has failed to generate the expected data or has encountered some other error. This stops the Observable and it will not make further calls to onNext or onCompleted. The onError method takes as its parameter an indication of what caused the error (sometimes an object like an Exception or Throwable, other times a simple string, depending on the implementation).\r\n\r\n**onCompleted**\r\n\r\nAn Observable calls this method after it has called onNext for the final time, if it has not encountered any errors.\r\n\r\n### Difference between the methods .pipe() and .subscribe() on a RXJS observable\r\n\r\nFirst, consider this function deposit() - It returns the Subscription object, becuase thats what is created when you call a `.subscribe()`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n    deposit(account, amount){\r\n    return this.http.get('url')\r\n    .subscribe(res => {\r\n        return res;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now with .pipe()\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n    deposit(account, amount){\r\n    return this.http.get('url')\r\n    .pipe(\r\n        map(res => {\r\n            return res;\r\n        });\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the second case, while using pipe, if you do not subscribe, nothing happens. pipe just combines several operators together. The second example return an Observable, but it does not execute. So if I want to actually get the emitted value of the Observable, then I have to use `.subscirbe()` after using `.pipe()`\r\n\r\nThe pipe method is for chaining observable operators, and the subscribe is for activating the observable and listening for emitted values.\r\n\r\nThe pipe method was added to allow webpack to drop unused operators from the final JavaScript bundle. It makes it easier to build smaller files.\r\n"

            "content": "Say we are creating an application that displays a product list. When the user clicks on a product in the list, we want to display a page showing the detailed information about that product. To do this you must:\r\n\r\n-   add a route parameter ID\r\n-   link the route to the parameter\r\n-   add the service that reads the parameter.\r\n\r\n#### Declaring Route Parameters\r\n\r\nThe route for the component that displays the details for a specific product would need a route parameter for the ID of that product. We could implement this using the following Routes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const routes: Routes = [\r\n\t{ path: \"\", redirectTo: \"product-list\", pathMatch: \"full\" },\r\n\t{ path: \"product-list\", component: ProductList },\r\n\t{ path: \"product-details/:id\", component: ProductDetails }\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote `:id` in the path of the product-details route, which places the parameter in the path. For example, to see the product details page for product with ID 5, you must use the following URL: localhost:3000/product-details/5\r\nwe know it’s a variable since it begins with a colon :\r\nA path can have any number of variables as long as they all start with : and have different names.\r\n\r\nLinking to Routes with Parameters\r\nIn the ProductList component you could display a list of products. Each product would have a link to the product-details route, passing the ID of the product:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<a *ngFor=\"let product of products\"\r\n  [routerLink]=\"['/product-details', product.id]\">\r\n  {{ product.name }}\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the routerLink directive passes an array which specifies the path and the route parameter. Alternatively we could navigate to the route programmatically:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ngoToProductDetails(id) {\r\n  this.router.navigate(['/product-details', id]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### And now finally, Reading Route Parameters\r\n\r\nThe ProductDetails component (LoanDetailsPage in the below example) must read the parameter, then load the product based on the ID given in the parameter.\r\n\r\nThe **ActivatedRoute** service provides a params Observable which we can subscribe to to get the route parameters (see Observables).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'product-details',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <div>\r\n      Showing product details for product: {{id}}\r\n    </div>\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class LoanDetailsPage implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\r\n  id: number;\r\n  private sub: any;\r\n\r\n  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    this.sub = this.route.params.subscribe(params => {\r\n       this.id = +params['id']; // (+) converts string 'id' to a number\r\n\r\n       // In a real app: dispatch action to load the details here.\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnDestroy() {\r\n    this.sub.unsubscribe();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason that the params property on ActivatedRoute is an Observable is that the router may not recreate the component when navigating to the same component. In this case the parameter may change without the component being recreated.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/routing/routeparams](https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/routing/routeparams)\r\n"

Therefore we could consider passing streams to child components as a bad practice because it creates a very tight link between the parent component and the child component. They are no longer decoupled since subscriptions in the child component might trigger actions in the parent component. We never want the child component to be responsible of initiating data calls right?! That’s the task of the smart component. See the difference between smart and dumb components here. A component should always receive an object or value and should not even care if that object or value comes from a stream or not.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// BAD\r\n// app.component.ts\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'app',\r\n    template: `\r\n        <!--\r\n            BAD: The users$ steram is passed\r\n            to user-detail directly as a stream\r\n        -->\r\n        <user-detail [user$]=\"user$\"></user-detail>\r\n    `\r\n})\r\nclass AppComponent {\r\n    // this http call will get called when the\r\n    // user-detail component subscribes to users$\r\n    // We don't want that\r\n    users$ = this.http.get(...);\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// user-detail.component.ts\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'user-detail',\r\n    template: `\r\n\r\n    `\r\n})\r\nclass UserDetailComponent implements OnInit {\r\n    @Input() user$: Observable<User>;\r\n    user: User;\r\n    ngOnInit(){\r\n        // WHOOPS! This child component subscribes to the stream\r\n        // of the parent component which will do an automatic XHR call\r\n        // because Angular HTTP returns a cold stream\r\n        this.user$.subscribe(u => this.user = u);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n"

They might be needed to kick-start some processing or fire the first request to load the initial data.\r\nIn such scenarios we can use RxJS take(1) operator which is great because it automatically unsubscribes after the first execution.\r\n\r\nBut note that the take(1) will not fire (and complete the observable stream) in case the original observable never emits. We have to make sure we only use it in cases where this can’t happen or provide additional unsubscription handling! \r\n\r\nThat take(1) still doesn’t unsubscribe when component is being destroyed. The subscription remains active until first value is emitted no matter if component is active or destroyed. So if we do something more crazy, like accessing the DOM, in our subscription — we might end up with an error in the console\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/angular-in-depth/the-best-way-to-unsubscribe-rxjs-observable-in-the-angular-applications-d8f9aa42f6a0](https://medium.com/angular-in-depth/the-best-way-to-unsubscribe-rxjs-observable-in-the-angular-applications-d8f9aa42f6a0)"

When a new value is emitted, the async pipe marks the component to be checked for changes. \r\n\r\n#### When the component gets destroyed, the asyncpipe automatically unsubscribes  all active subscriptions to avoid potential memory leaks.\r\n\r\nUsing the async pipe is a huge advantage if we are using Observables in our components because it will subscribe to them and unsubscribe from them. We will not be bothered about forgetting to unsubscribe from them in ngOnDestroy when the component is being killed off.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./async_pipe.png\">\r\n\r\nAnother big advantage of using | async pipe together with *ngIf directive is that we can guarantee that the unwrapped value will be available to all child components at the time they are rendered.\r\nSuch an approach helps us to prevent excessive use of “elvis” operator (?.)in our templates which is used to get rid prop of undefined errors...\r\n\r\nWithout <ng-container> it would look more like this…\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./async_pipe-2.png\">\r\n\r\nAs a conclusion \r\n\r\nwe should always use async pipe when possible and only use .subscribe when the side effect is an absolute necessity as we are safe as long as we stay in the observable. The code terminating the observable should be the framework (Angular) and the last piece (the UI). \r\n\r\nA real life example \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn above case I really dont need to unsubscribe. Instead transforming the params object to the `character` list using the `switchMap` operator. And  managing the subscription imperatively by unwrapping it in the template with the async pipe.\r\n\r\nCreate your character observable.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nthis.characters$ = this.activatedRoute.params\r\n  .pipe(switchMap(parms => this.fetchCharactersByBook(parms.bookId)));\r\n```\r\nThe dollar $ is a convention to know that the variable is observable. \r\n\r\nOnce the observable is created, then to display from the UI, we would need to use the async pipe. \r\nWill need to use the **async pipe** to unwrap it by replacing template references (i.e. in .html file) to `characters list` directly with\r\n\r\n`characters$ | async`\r\n\r\nThe component will dispose of the `characters$`` observable as part of the tear down process.\r\n\r\n#### Another example\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncosts$: Observable<Cost[]>;\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n    this.costs$ = this.getCosts()\r\n        .combineLatest(this.getFilter())\r\n        .map(([costs, filter]) => costs.filter(e => e.type === filter));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen to display from the UI, we would need to use the async pipe.\r\n\r\n`{{ costs$ | async }}``\r\n\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/isop-nepal/subscribe-vs-async-pipe-in-angular-21bb38f3ee49](https://medium.com/isop-nepal/subscribe-vs-async-pipe-in-angular-21bb38f3ee49)"

One of the variants of the Subject is the BehaviorSubject. The BehaviorSubject has the characteristic that it stores the “current” value.\r\n**BehaviourSubject** is both an Observer and and Observable\r\n\r\nThe **share()** operator is brought in here, so if we have multiple subscribers to this, it shares the one http request among them, untill the http request is done. So we dont expand the server whole bunch.\r\n\r\n#### Context as to why `share()` operator is needed in the above code\r\n\r\nBecause by default, **Observables** lazily instantiate their data flow, concretely initiating the dataflow when a subscriber subscribes. Subscribing to an observable will result in an upstream chain of subscriptions taking place. The last subscription leads to the execution of a function which will handle a source and emit its data to its observer.\r\nWhen a second subscriber subscribes to the same observable, another new dataflow is started as if it is was the first subscriber. Meaning, each subscription creates a new chain of observables. This is what is coined in RxJS terminology as a **cold observable** and that's the default behaviour for RxJS observable. If you want an observable which sends (or shares) its data to all the subscribers it has at the moment the data arrives, that would be coined a **hot observable**, and one way to get a hot observable is to use the **share operator**.\r\n\r\n`share` makes the observable \"**hot**\" if these 2 conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1. The number of subscribers > 0\r\n2. AND the observable has not completed\r\n\r\nScenario1: number of subscribers > 0 and observable is not completed before a new subscription\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./newsfeed-flow-code.png\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./newsfeed-flow.png\">\r\n\r\n#### Component Code where the reload is controlled with `pageY`\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nrefresh = new EventEmitter<any>()\r\n\r\nprivate _pos = 0;\r\n\r\ntouchStart$ =  fromEvent<TouchEvent>(document, 'touchstart')\r\ntouchMove$ = fromEvent<TouchEvent>(document, 'touchmove')\r\ntouchEnd$ = fromEvent<TouchEvent>(document, 'touchend')\r\n\r\n/* The touchmove event occurs when the user moves the finger across the screen.

Take touchDrag$\r\n2. And when touchDrag is done then start moveHomeAfterLoad$ observable\r\n3. And moveHomeAfterLoad$ observable will wait till loadNews$ observable is done\r\n4. Thats why we have to add repeat() - Bcz Observable are lazy, so we have to subscribe to them again when they are done.\r\n */\r\npositionUpdate$ = concat(\r\n  this.touchDrag$,\r\n  this.moveHomeAfterLoad$,\r\n).pipe(\r\n  repeat()\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npositions$ = this.touchDrag$.pipe(\r\n  startWith(0),\r\n  map(y => y - 70)\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**concat() method** - concat joins multiple Observables together, by subscribing to them one at a time and merging their results into the output Observable. You can pass either an array of Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result in Observable that completes immediately. So concat() basically means, play the first observable till its done, then play next observable\r\n\r\n**exhaustMap() method** - Projects each source value to an Observable which is merged in the output Observable only if the previous projected Observable has completed. So in the above code\r\n\r\n```js\r\nthis.touchMove$.pipe(\r\n  map((move) => move.touches[0].pageY - start.touches[0].pageY),\r\n  takeUntil(this.touchEnd$),\r\n  tap((p) => this._pos * p),\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in the above code it says, do the touchMovements until touchEnd and ONLY then do moveHome (which will play the rxAnimation)\r\n"

Let's say we wanted to debounce search queries and dismiss consecutive duplicates.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Search.SearchReusableChild\r\nimport { OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { Subject } from 'rxjs';\r\nimport { debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged } from 'rxjs/operators';\r\n\r\nexport class ReusableSearchComponent implements OnDestroy {\r\n  private searchQuery = new Subject<string>();\r\n\r\n  searchQuery$ = this.searchQuery.pipe(\r\n    debounceTime(150), // 👈\r\n    distinctUntilChanged(), // 👈\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  ngOnDestroy(): void {\r\n    this.searchQuery.complete();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  search(query: string): void {\r\n    this.searchQuery.next(query);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n// Now let this integrate this reusable component to a search box component as below.\r\n\r\n\r\n// search-box.component.ts\r\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, OnInit, Output } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\nimport { ReusableSearchComponent } from './Search.SearchReusableChild';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  providers: [ReusableSearchComponent],\r\n  selector: 'app-search-box',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <input\r\n      type=\"search\"\r\n      placeholder=\"Search...\"\r\n      (input)=\"onSearch($event.target.value)\"> <!-- [1] -->\r\n  `,\r\n})\r\nexport class SearchParentComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  @Output()\r\n  search = new EventEmitter<string>();\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private reusableSearch: ReusableSearchComponent,\r\n  ) {}\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n    this.reusableSearch.searchQuery$.subscribe(searchQuery => // [4]\r\n      this.search.emit(searchQuery)); // [4]\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  onSearch(query: string): void { // [2]\r\n    this.reusableSearch.search(query); // [3]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe only have a dataflow going in one direction. The user enters search queries (1) which are intercepted by the component's event handler (2). The queries are then filtered through the reusableSearch (3). Finally, the reusableSearch's search query observable is connected to the component's output property (4), allowing parent components to use event binding to be notified of user searches.\r\n\r\nWe've effectively tied the reusableSearch to a search box. If that's the only place where we're going to use this user interaction logic, we might as well reuse the search box component rather than the search reusableSearch. In this way, our consumers–or parent components–only have to use the search box component and bind to its search event to add search functionality.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://indepth.dev/presenters-with-angular/](https://indepth.dev/presenters-with-angular/)\r\n"

Pipeable operators: These are operators that can be piped to existing Observables using the pipe syntax.\r\n\r\n`observableInstance.pipe(operator())`\r\n\r\nThey are called on existing Observables and they do not change the Observable instance, they return a new Observable with a subscribe method based on the initial Observable.\r\n\r\nB. Creation operators: These operators, on the other hand, create an Observable with either a pre-defined behavior or by joining more than one Observable together. They can be referred to as standalone methods that create new Observables.\r\n\r\n## of()\r\n\r\nThis is creation operator used to create Observables from any kind of data, be it a string or an array, an object or even a promise. Test it out with this code block below:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Component, OnInit } from \"@angular/core\"\r\nimport { Observable, of } from \"rxjs\"\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"app-root\",\r\n  templateUrl: \"./app.component.html\",\r\n  styleUrls: [\"./app.component.css\"],\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    const observable1 = of(1, 2, 3).subscribe((data) => console.log(data))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## map()\r\n\r\nThis is an operator defined in a pipe inside, with which you can modify the content of emitted values from one observable to form another new observable. In your app.component.ts file copy in the code block below:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Component, OnInit } from \"@angular/core\"\r\nimport { Observable, of } from \"rxjs\"\r\nimport { map } from \"rxjs/operators\"\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: \"app-root\",\r\n  templateUrl: \"./app.component.html\",\r\n  styleUrls: [\"./app.component.css\"],\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    const observable1 = of(\"my name is lotanna\")\r\n    observable1\r\n      .pipe(map((data) => data.toUpperCase()))\r\n      .subscribe((data) => console.log(data))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInside the pipe, you can then add your modification logic, in above case it is to convert the emitted values to upper case.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[use-rxjs-operators-to-consume-observables/](https://blog.logrocket.com/use-rxjs-operators-to-consume-observables/)\r\n"

Pipes in Angular: A pipe takes in data as input and transforms it to the desired output\r\n   [https://angular.io/guide/pipes](https://angular.io/guide/pipes)\r\n\r\n2. pipe() function in RxJS: You can use pipes to link operators together. Pipes let you combine multiple functions into a single function.\r\n\r\nThe pipe() function takes as its arguments the functions you want to combine, and returns a new function that, when executed, runs the composed functions in sequence.\r\n[https://angular.io/guide/rx-library](https://angular.io/guide/rx-library) (search for pipes in this URL, you can find the same)\r\n\r\npipe() is a function/method that is used to chain multiple RxJS operators while map() and filter() are operators that operate and transform the values of an Observable (sequence of values). They are similar to the map() and filter() methods of JavaScript arrays.\r\n\r\nWhat does this pipe() function exactly mean in this case?\r\n\r\n```js\r\nreturn (\r\n  this.http.get <\r\n  Hero >\r\n  url.pipe(\r\n    tap((_) => this.log(`fetched hero id=${id}`)),\r\n    catchError(this.handleError < Hero > `getHero id=${id}`),\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe pipe() in above example is the pipe() method of RxJS 5.5 (RxJS is the default for all Angular apps).\r\n\r\nThe pipe() function takes as its arguments the functions you want to combine, and returns a new function that, when executed, runs the composed functions in sequence.\r\n\r\ntap() - RxJS tap operator will look at the Observable value and do something with that value. In other words, after a successful API request, the tap() operator will do any function you want it to perform with the response. In the example, it will just log that string.\r\n\r\ncatchError() - catchError does exactly the same thing but with error response. If you want to throw an error or want to call some function if you get an error, you can do it here. In the example, it will call handleError() and inside that, it will just log that string.\r\n\r\nRxJS Operators are functions that build on the observables foundation to enable sophisticated manipulation of collections.\r\n\r\nFor example, RxJS defines operators such as map(), filter(), concat(), and flatMap().\r\n\r\nYou can use pipes to link operators together. Pipes let you combine multiple functions into a single function.\r\n\r\nIt decouples the streaming operations (map, filter, reduce...) from the core functionality(subscribing, piping). By piping operations instead of chaining, it doesn't pollute the prototype of Observable making it easier to do tree shaking.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48668701/what-is-pipe-for-in-rxjs/56881298](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48668701/what-is-pipe-for-in-rxjs/56881298)\r\n"

            "content": "switchMap() operators\r\n\r\n`switchMap()` does exactly what it says, it switches from the primary observable to a secondary (or 'inner') observable.\r\n`switchMap` is often recommended with the subscription because of its advantages compared to other flattening operators. It will switch to a new observable and cancel the previous observable.\r\n\r\n`switchMap` is usually used when you have some async operation that is triggered by some prepended \"event/stream\". The difference to e.g. `flatMap` or `concatMap` is, that as soon as the next trigger emits, the current async operation is canceled and re-triggered.\r\n\r\n#### One of the most common usecase of switchMap() is to pull a url parma (the employee ID in the below code example ), and retrieve the employee to display.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';\r\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { Router, ActivatedRoute, ParamMap } from '@angular/router';\r\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs';\r\n\r\nimport { EmployeeService }  from '../employee.service';\r\nimport { Employee} from '../employee;\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-employee-detail',\r\n  templateUrl: './employee-detail.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./employee-detail.component.css']\r\n})\r\nexport class EmployeeDetailComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  employee$: Observable<Hero>;\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n        \tprivate route: ActivatedRoute,\r\n        \tprivate router: Router,\r\n        \tprivate service: EmployeeService\r\n  ) {}\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n        \tthis.employee$ = this.route.paramMap.pipe(\r\n            switchMap((params: ParamMap) =>\r\n        \t    this.service.getEmployee(params.get('id')))\r\n        \t);\r\n  }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in above, as the route-params change, my service.getEmployee() is automatically called again with the changed params and the previous call is canceled so you won't receive outdated data.\r\n\r\nSo in above, if I subscribe to the paramMap and I start spamming changes to the route parameters, switchMap will cancel any pending requests and pick up the new request. If you make an HTTP request within the subscription then use switchMap to cancel any unnecessary pending request.\r\n\r\nTo compare switchMap with its other rx-js counterparts.\r\n\r\nflatMap/mergeMap - creates an Observable immediately for any source item, all previous Observables are kept alive\r\nconcatMap - waits for the previous Observable to complete before creating the next one\r\nswitchMap - for any source item, completes the previous Observable and immediately creates the next one\r\nexhaustMap - source items are ignored while the previous Observable is not completed\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49698640/flatmap-mergemap-switchmap-and-concatmap-in-rxjs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49698640/flatmap-mergemap-switchmap-and-concatmap-in-rxjs)\r\n\r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42655134/angular-2-why-use-switchmap-when-retrieving-route-params](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42655134/angular-2-why-use-switchmap-when-retrieving-route-params)\r\n"

            "content": "### lets see a more interesting and more directly use-experience enhancing effect of using switchMap()\r\n\r\nHere we will explore the case when a user types some text in an input box and based on that text an api call is being executed to the backend to fetch the relevant data. And we certainly want to make this as smooth and fast experience for the user as possible.\r\n\r\nFirst note that, the benefits of using a switchMap() operator will becomes, clearer when we execute a time consuming function. Lets define one,\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { flatMap, switchMap } from \"rxjs/operators\"\r\n\r\nfunction timeConsumingJob(input) {\r\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      resolve(\"response based on \" + input)\r\n    }, 2000)\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this code, we have a function that takes 2 seconds to execute, and let's see the effect if we keep using the flatMap() operator in executing this job:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet longRunningStream$ = keyStream$\r\n  .map((ev) => ev.key)\r\n  .filter((key) => elem.value.length > 3)\r\n  .filter((key) => key !== \"Backspace\")\r\n  .flatMap((key) => Rx.Observable.from(timeConsumingJob(elem.value)))\r\n\r\nlongRunningStream$.subscribe((data) => console.log(data))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith above code, every time user hits a key, it generates an event. However, we have a .filter() operator in place that ensures an event is only generated when at least four keys are entered,\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfilter((key) => elem.value.length > 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, if a user enters keys in an input control, they expect a request to be made when they are done typing. A user defines being done as entering a few characters and also that they should be able to move characters if they were mistyped. So assume the following input sequences - that almost all of us do regularly:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// enters abcde\r\nabcde\r\n// removes 'e'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point, they have entered characters and then reasonably quickly, edited their answer. The user expects to receive an answer based on `abcd` Using the `flatMap()` operator here, however, means the user will get two answers back because, in\r\nreality, they typed `abcde` and `abcd`.\r\n\r\nImagine we get a results list based on these two inputs - it would most likely be two lists that looked somewhat different.\r\n\r\n**First the full response based on `abcde`**\r\n\r\n**And then the full response based on `abcd`**\r\n\r\nOur code and app most likely would be able to handle the situation described by re-rendering the results list as soon as a new response arrives. There are two problems with this though:\r\n\r\nfirstly, we do an unnecessary network request for abcde, and secondly, if the backend is fast enough in responding, we will see a flickering in the UI as the result list is rendered\r\nonce and then, shortly after, is rendered again, based on the second response. This is not good, and we want to have a situation where the first request will be abandoned if we keep\r\non typing. This is where the switchMap() operator comes in. It does exactly that.\r\n\r\nLet's therefore alter the preceding code to the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet longRunningStream$ = keyStream$\r\n  .map((ev) => ev.key)\r\n  .filter((key) => elem.value.length > 3)\r\n  .filter((key) => key !== \"Backspace\")\r\n  .switchMap((key) => Rx.Observable.from(timeConsumingJob(elem.value)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this code, we simply switched our `flatMap()` to a `switchMap()`. When we now execute the code in the exact same way, that is, the user firstly typing `abcde` and shortly altering\r\nthat to `abcd`, the end result is:\r\n\r\n**the full response based on `abcd`**\r\n\r\nBecause with `switchMap` we get one request only. The reason for this is that the previous event is aborted when a new event happens — `switchMap()` is doing its magic.\r\n"

Maybe you want to see what the user first clicked on when they entered the page, or you would want to subscribe to the click event and just take the first emission. Another use-case is when you need to take a snapshot of data at a particular point in time but do not require further emissions. For example, a stream of user token updates, or a route guard based on a stream in an Angular application.\r\n\r\n`take` is the opposite of `skip` where take will take the first n number of emissions while `skip` will skip the first n number of emissions.\r\n\r\n### A simple example\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n    getProfile() { // this is a call to REST API\r\n    return this.service.getProfile()\r\n            .map(res => res.json())\r\n            .take(1)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nthis.data.getProfile().subscribe(profile => {\r\n    this.userProfile = profile;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the usage of take(1) here? The author did not unsubscribe after subscribe. Is it because the author use take(1) therefore manual unsubscribe is not needed?\r\n\r\n### Ans - Yes, that is most likely why the author uses take(1) operator. It's job is to pass one value to an observable and then unsubscribe from the source. But depending on the service it may not be required.\r\n\r\n### For example in Angular the HttpClient service completes the stream by itself after sending the final HttpResponse event value so you don't need to neither use take nor unsubscribe explicitly.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n1.

                "content": "Before we dive into TypeScript’s private feature let’s do a quick recap of JavaScript classes. In the new ES2015 standard of JavaScript we get a Object Oriented Class style syntax that looks like the following,\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport class Person {\r\n    constructor(name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    sayHello() {\r\n        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}!`);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst cory = new Person(\"Cory\");\r\ncory.sayHello(); // Hello, my name is Cory!\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example above, we are using pure JavaScript no TypeScript syntax or features are being used. JavaScript classes can be exported and used in other JavaScript modules. JavaScript classes also have constructors, properties, and methods similar to most Class-based languages we see today. Unfortunately, in the current version of JavaScript, there is no support for private properties or private methods yet. In JavaScript all class instance properties and methods are public.\r\n\r\n### TypeScript Private Properties\r\n\r\nUsing TypeScript, we can add private functionality into our classes. What are private properties or methods? A private property of method can only be accessed or called from the class instance itself. Let’s take a look at an example private property.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport class Person {\r\n    // declare our property types\r\n    firstName: string;\r\n    lastName: string;\r\n    private _age: number;\r\n\r\n    // when accessing the age property return the private _age\r\n    // getters and setters are part of the JavaScript Class syntax\r\n    get age() {\r\n        return this._age;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string, age: number) {\r\n        this.firstName = firstName;\r\n        this.lastName = lastName;\r\n        this._age = age;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    sayHello() {\r\n        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}!`);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Only this method can update the private _age\r\n    addOneYear() {\r\n        this._age = this._age + 1;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst cory = new Person(\"Cory\", \"Rylan\", 100);\r\ncory.addOneYear();\r\nconsole.log(cory.age); // 101\r\n\r\ncory._age = 200; // error: Property '_age' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'.\r\nconsole.log(cory._age); // error: Property '_age' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'.\r\ncory.age = 200; // error: Cannot assign to 'age' because it is a constant or a read-only property.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we are using a typical pattern of a private property to control how a property is updated. In our use case, it is valid to increase the age of a person, but you cannot set it to a random value or a younger age. To enforce this, we create a private property \\_age. The \\_age property is a property that will be only available internally to the class. For example, if I try to set \\_age I get an error because it is private to the class. If I try to read \\_age I also get the same error\r\n\r\nWe can see the private hides the property from the user/consumer of the class. If I try to set cory.age we also get an error because I defined only a get for the age property with no set so this property can only be read-only. We can go one step further and refactor our constructor a little bit more.\r\n\r\n#### TypeScript Constructor Assignment\r\n\r\nIn this example, we can simplify our constructor parameters by combining the declaration and assignment into a single statement.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport class Person {\r\n    private _age: number;\r\n\r\n    get age() {\r\n        return this._age;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    constructor(\r\n        public firstName: string,\r\n        public lastName: string,\r\n        age: number\r\n    ) {\r\n        this._age = age;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    sayHello() {\r\n        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}!`);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    addOneYear() {\r\n        this._age = this._age + 1;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst cory = new Person(\"Cory\", \"Rylan\", 100);\r\ncory.sayHello();\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### TypeScript Private Methods\r\n\r\nMethods can also be private which is useful for hiding implementation detail of how a Class works to the user of the Class. Let’s take a look at a minimal example.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport class Person {\r\n    private _age: number;\r\n\r\n    get age() {\r\n        return this._age;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    constructor(\r\n        public firstName: string,\r\n        public lastName: string,\r\n        age: number\r\n    ) {\r\n        this._age = age;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // The private method log() can only be called by other methods in our class.\r\n    sayHello() {\r\n        this.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}!`);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    addOneYear() {\r\n        this._age = this._age + 1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private log(message) {\r\n        console.log(message);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst cory = new Person(\"Cory\", \"Rylan\", 100);\r\ncory.sayHello(); // Hello, my name is Cory Rylan!\r\ncory.log(\"hi\"); // error: Property 'log' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we created a private method log(). Log can only be called by other methods in our class. You can see above if I try to call log directly, we get a TypeScript error. Private properties and methods can help enforce logic for when data is updated and also enforce encapsulation of our classes.

In an object literal they are denoted by get and set:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nlet obj = {\r\n    get propName() {\r\n        // getter, the code executed on getting obj.propName\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    set propName(value) {\r\n        // setter, the code executed on setting obj.propName = value\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nTS offers getters and setters which allow object properties to have more control of how they are accessed (getter) or updated (setter) outside of the object. Instead of directly accessing or updating the property a proxy function is called.\r\n\r\nAccessor with a get and no set property are automatically assumed to be read-only no need for manual work. This is helpful when we are generating a .d.ts file from our code.\r\n\r\nget() is an instance method of typescript class.\r\n\r\nNote, instance members of the class, those that show up on the object when it’s instantiated.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass Person {\r\n    constructor(name: string) {\r\n        this._name = name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private _name: string;\r\n\r\n    get name() {\r\n        return this._name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // first checks the length of the name and then updates the name.\r\n    set name(name: string) {\r\n        if (name.length > 10) {\r\n            throw new Error(\"Name has a max length of 10\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        this._name = name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    doStuff() {\r\n        this._name = \"foofooooooofoooo\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst person = new Person(\"Willem\");\r\n\r\n// doesn't throw error, setter function not called within the object method when this._name is changed\r\nperson.doStuff();\r\n\r\n// throws error because setter is called and name is longer than 10 characters\r\nperson.name = \"barbarbarbarbarbar\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the different way doStuff() is invoked vs `person.name`\r\n"

Be careful with apps that have None components in the application.\r\n\r\nSince the default view encapsulation mode in Angular is Emulated, for us to specify a different mode in your components, we have to do like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from \"@angular/core\";\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n\tselector: \"app-servers\",\r\n\ttemplate: `\r\n    <h3 class=\"title\">App Servers Component</h3>\r\n    <app-server></app-server>\r\n  `,\r\n\tstyleUrls: [\"./servers.component.css\"],\r\n\t//encapsulation None\r\n\tencapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None\r\n})\r\nexport class ServersComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's try to understand it using an example.

There is no shadow DOM.\r\n    2.

This allows that styles from main HTML propagate to the component but styles defined in this component's @Component decorator are scoped to this component only.\r\n\r\nThe key point is\r\n\r\n**ViewEncapsulation.None** - No Shadow DOM, hence, no style encapsulation.\r\n\r\n**ViewEncapsulation.Emulated** - No Shadow DOM but emulated style encapsulation.\r\n\r\n**ViewEncapsulation.Native** - Proper Native Shadow DOM.\r\n\r\n#### ViewEncapsulation.None\r\n\r\nIn the **None** mode, styles from the component propagate back to the main HTML and therefore are visible to all components on the page. Be careful with apps that have None components in the application.\r\n\r\nSince the default view encapsulation mode in Angular is Emulated, for us to specify a different mode in your components, we have to do like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from \"@angular/core\";\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n\tselector: \"app-servers\",\r\n\ttemplate: `\r\n    <h3 class=\"title\">App Servers Component</h3>\r\n    <app-server></app-server>\r\n  `,\r\n\tstyleUrls: [\"./servers.component.css\"],\r\n\t//encapsulation None\r\n\tencapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None\r\n})\r\nexport class ServersComponent {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's try to understand it using an example. I have created a component, as shown below:\r\n\r\n##### app.component.ts\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from \"@angular/core\";\r\n@Component({\r\n\tselector: \"app-root\",\r\n\ttemplateUrl: \"./app.component.html\",\r\n\tstyleUrls: [\"./app.component.css\"],\r\n\tencapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n\ttitle = \"parent component\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### app.component.html app.component.css\r\n\r\n```css\r\nh1 {\r\n\tbackground: red;\r\n\tcolor: white;\r\n\ttext-transform: uppercase;\r\n\ttext-align: center;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe are setting the style of h1 in the component CSS. We have also created another component:\r\n\r\n##### AppChildComponent.ts\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\";\r\n@Component({\r\n\tselector: \"app-child\",\r\n\ttemplate: `\r\n  <h1>{{title}}</h1>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class AppChildComponent {\r\n\ttitle = \"child app\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet us start with ViewEncapsulation.None, in this option:\r\n\r\n    1. There is no shadow DOM.\r\n    2. Style is not scoped to the component.\r\n\r\n**As you run the application, you will find h1 style has applied to both components, even though we only set style the in AppComponent. This happened because in AppComponent we have set the encapsulation property to ViewEncapsulation.None.**\r\n\r\n```js\r\n@Component({\r\n\tselector: \"app-root\",\r\n\ttemplateUrl: \"./app.component.html\",\r\n\tstyleUrls: [\"./app.component.css\"],\r\n\tencapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n\ttitle = \"parent component\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./view-encapsulation-none.png\">\r\n\r\nIn the browser, when you examine source code, you will find the h1 style has been declared in the head section of the DOM.\r\n\r\nIn AppChildComponent, we are also using the h1 tag. To understand different ViewEncapsulation options, we will change the metadata of AppComponent.\r\n\r\n**Therefore, in ViewEncapsulation.None, the style gets moved to the DOM's head section and is not scoped to the component. There is no Shadow DOM for the component and the component style can affect all nodes in the DOM.**\r\n\r\n### ::ng-deep going to be deprecated - Any alternatives?\r\n\r\nThe only way forward without using that operator in your CSS is to completely opt out of letting Angular manage the style encapsulation for your component by doing this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n    ...\r\n    encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If you do this, your styles become global though, so make sure you prepend each style rule with your component to make sure that they don't leak beyond that. This will make the .scss styles in this component global to the whole application.** For example, if you have a MyCustomComponent component with a selector of my-custom-component:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nmy-custom-component button {\r\n\t...;\r\n} /* good */\r\nbutton {\r\n\t...;\r\n} /* bad */\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter scouring through the actual notes from the committee meetings on this stuff, it doesn't look like there is an alternative put forward yet. Using the ::ng-deep syntax ensures that you let Angular take care of breaking out of the style encapsulation (for DOM nodes in child components in your template) that they are doing for your styles (and not using browser native features, making it more future-proof obviously).\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://dev.to/monicafidalgo/what-is-viewencapsulation-in-angular-470o](https://dev.to/monicafidalgo/what-is-viewencapsulation-in-angular-470o)\r\n\r\n[https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-viewencapsulation-in-angular](https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-viewencapsulation-in-angular)\r\n"

The selector can be used as attribute selector by putting it inside a square brackets:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: '[app-element]',\r\n    template:  './element.component.html',\r\n    styleUrls: ['./element.component.css']\r\n})\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this, we have changed our selector to be an attribute. To access this type of attribute selector we have to put this as an attribute inside a div or any other element as:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<div app-element></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother implementation of this category is as follows\r\n\r\nIn the .html of the parent component (lets say its a reusable Modal component)\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"modal-body\">\r\n  <!-- Content -->\r\n  <ng-content select=\"[modalBody]\"></ng-content>\r\n  <!-- End Modal Content -->\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then I can use the modalBody in another component which implements the modal like so\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div modalBody>\r\n  ...... ......\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. The selector can also be selected by class just like in a CSS, by putting a dot in the beginning:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: '.app-element',\r\n    template:  './element.component.html',\r\n    styleUrls: ['./element.component.css']\r\n})\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this, we can select by class as:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"app-element\"></div>\r\n```\r\n"

I think ng-content is one of the simplest ways to do that once you understand how it works.\r\n\r\nDynamic content. That is the simplest way to explain what ng-content provides. You use the\r\n`<ng-content></ng-content>` tag as a placeholder for that dynamic content, then when the template is parsed Angular will replace that placeholder tag with your content. Think of it like curly brace interpolation, but on a bigger scale. The technical term for this is “content projection\" because you are projecting content from the parent component into the designated child component.\r\nIf you understand {{myValue}}, then you understand the basics of what ng-content does. The difference is where that value comes from. With normal curly brace interpolation the value comes from the component. With ng-content the value comes from the component in its execution context.\r\n\r\nLet’s say you want to create a reusable button in your app.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./ng-content-1.png\">\r\n\r\nHere we can see a generic add button which triggers an event when clicked. Nothing crazy here. The main thing I want to point out is the button’s text. “Add New Item\" is hard-coded in the template. But, what if we wanted to get more specific with our button text? For example, “Add Coffee\". We could put that value in the component like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./ng-content-2.png\">\r\n\r\nOr even as an Input from the parent component like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./ng-content-3.png\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./ng-content-4.png\">\r\n\r\nThese ways work but this is where ng-content shines. Take a look at this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./ng-content-5.png\">\r\n\r\nSee what’s happening here?\r\n\r\nIn the template for the reusable add button component we use the <ng-content></ng-content> tag as our placeholder for the button text. This is telling Angular, “Hey, I don’t know what this is supposed to be right now but, I promise to tell you later”.\r\n\r\nThen when the button component is actually being used… BAM! We put whatever text we want inside the component\r\n\r\nDynamic text is just the tip of the metaphorical iceberg though. You can put lots of different things inside the component.

The ngmodel directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data. \r\n\r\nThe FormControl instance tracks the value, user interaction, and validation status of the control and keeps the view synced with the model. If used within a parent form, the directive also registers itself with the form as a child control.\r\n\r\nThis directive is used by itself or as part of a larger form. Use the ngModel selector to activate it.\r\n\r\n[Official Doc](https://angular.io/api/forms/NgModel)\r\n\r\n#### Difference between [(ngModel)] and [ngModel] for binding state to property?\r\n\r\nAngular2+ data flow:\r\n--------------------\r\nIn Angular the data can flow between the model (component class ts.file) and view (html of the component) in the following manners:\r\n\r\n 1. From the model  to the view. \r\n 2. From the view to the model.\r\n 3. Data flows in both directions, also known as **2 way data binding**. \r\n\r\nSyntax:\r\n-------\r\n\r\n**model to view:**\r\n\r\n    <input type=\"text\" [ngModel]=\"overRideRate\">\r\n\r\nThis syntax is also known as **property binding**. Now if the `overRideRate` property of the input field changes the view automatically will get updated. However if the view updates when the user enters a number the `overRideRate`  property will not be updated.\r\n\r\n**view to model:**\r\n\r\n    (input)=\"change($event)\"            // calling a method called change from the component class\r\n    (input)=\"overRideRate=$event.target.value\" // on input save the new value in the title property\r\n\r\n#### What happens here is that an event is triggered (in this case input event, but could be any event). We then can call methods of the component class or directly save the property in a class property.\r\n\r\n**2-way data binding:**\r\n\r\nThe following syntax is used for 2-way data binding. It is basically a syntactic sugar  for both:\r\n\r\n 1. Binding model to view.\r\n 2. Binding view to model\r\n    \r\n<input [(ngModel)]=\"overRideRate\" type=\"text\" >\r\n\r\n#### Now something changes inside our class this will reflect our view (model to view), and whenever the user changes the input the model will be updated (view to model). \r\n\r\nSo in a single statement -\r\n\r\n[ngModel] evaluates the code and generates an output (without two-way binding).\r\n\r\n[(ngModel)] evaluates the code and generates an output and also enables two-way binding.\r\n\r\n\r\nA regular example from actual use-cases\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<ng-select\r\n      [items]=\"dropdownOptions\"\r\n      bindLabel=\"displayValue\"      \r\n      [(ngModel)]=\"ngSelectSelectedItem\"      \r\n    >\r\n</ng-select>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a background, by default `ng-select` binds to default `label` property for display, and keeps whole `object` as selected value"

Make an array named \"args\" with each given arguments as the array elements\r\n\r\n 3. From that array, find the no that has the longest digits after decimal. The \"maxLen\" variable will hold the count of that max digits.\r\n\r\n 4. For each of the \"args\" elements, split it by decimal point as the separator. So make a variable n1, which is 2-element array, and n1[0] for digits before decimal and  n1[1] for after decimal.\r\n\r\n 5. Right pad all n1[1] elements with 0's ( Number(c).toFixed(maxLen) ) - so that each numbers have the same number of decimal points.\r\n\r\n 6. Inside the reduce() function, the callback's argument's (p, c) previous variable \"p\" is a 2 element array, which I am making, by setting the initialValue to the array [0, 0]. And in the add() function if only 2 numbers are passed, the variable \"p\" will take only 2 values throughout the execution of the program which are [0, 0] and the first argument ( in the test case here [154, 9900]) .\r\n\r\n 7. And the argument \"c\" will just hold the current value.\r\n\r\n 8. Now simply add the numeric values of each of the p[0] and n[0] - p[0] = Number(p[0]) + Number(n1[0]) .\r\n And same for p[1] and n[1] - for digits before decimal and after decimal respectively.\r\n\r\n 9. If the length of summation p[1] and n[1]'s are more than \"maxLen\" then implement arithmetic rule of pulling out the left-most position's digit to be added to the summation of the digits that are before decimal.\r\n\r\n 10. Put decimal back in the final summation, remove trailing zeros\r\n*/\r\n\r\nfunction add() {\r\n  //Make an array with each given arguments as the array elements\r\n  var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);\r\n  if (isNaN(args[0]) || isNaN(args[1]))\r\n    return NaN;\r\n\r\n  var maxLen = 0; // This variable will hold the count of the max no of digits after a decimal out of both the passed-in arguments\r\n\r\n  args.forEach(function(i) {\r\n    // regex match for decimal (.) .\r\n    if (/[.]/g.test(i.toString())) {\r\n      // Now return the length of the string after splitting it by the decimal\r\n      var len = i.toString().split(\".\")[1].length;\r\n      if (len >= maxLen) {\r\n        maxLen = len;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  var leftMostExtraDecimalPlace = 0;\r\n  // Right pad the arg elements with 0's, so that each numbers have the same number of decimal points if its needed\r\n  // The variable r will finally return an array (with 2 elements), the final addition result. r[0] will be the digits before decimal, and r[1] will be digits after decimal.

Twenty of the group's volunteers assumed the licking challenge-unassisted by machinery-and averaged 252 licks each to the center.\r\n\r\nYour task, if you choose to accept it, is to write a function that will return the number of licks it took to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop, given some environmental variables.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows it's harder to lick a tootsie pop in cold weather but it's easier if the sun is out. You will be given an object of environmental conditions for each trial paired with a value that will increase or decrease the number of licks. The environmental conditions all apply to the same trial.\r\n\r\nAssuming that it would normally take 252 licks to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop, return the new total of licks along with the condition that proved to be most challenging (causing the most added licks) in that trial.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\ntotalLicks({ \"freezing temps\": 10, \"clear skies\": -2 });\r\nShould return:\r\n\r\n\"It took 260 licks to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop.

A tag is a function which has ability to interpret & process the template. This means we can run the template string through a function and have more control over how the template is converted to string representation.\r\n\r\nTags are just normal functions, but to be useful they have to be invoked differently.\r\nThe template literal is passed to tag function as multiple parameters. The first argument is a string array containing string literals from the template: First element in the array is string starting from index 0 to the first interpolated value, second element in the array is string after first interpolated value up-to next interpolation and so on until end of template is reached.\r\n\r\nAll the interpolated expressions are evaluated and passed to the tag as second argument on-wards in order of their occurrence. The tag can process the literals and evaluated expressions to form the return value.\r\n\r\nWhen the interpolation contains a function expression, it is evaluated as normal string in case of normal template literals. While the same expression is evaluated as function in case of tagged template literals and the tag can call that function.\r\n\r\n */\r\nfunction sides(literals, ...expressions) {\r\n    var area = expressions[0];\r\n    var perimeter = expressions[1];\r\n\r\n    var s1 = (perimeter + Math.sqrt(perimeter * perimeter - (16 * area))) / 4;\r\n    var s2 = (perimeter - Math.sqrt(perimeter * perimeter - (16 * area))) / 4;\r\n\r\n    var array = [s1, s2];\r\n    return array.sort(function(a, b) {\r\n        return a - b;\r\n    });\r\n}"

So I am accessing the first element (i.e. 1) of diagonal1 > which is matrix[row1][row1] >\r\nwhich is matrix[1st element of outer array][first element of inner array]  > in code which is matrix[0][0] .\r\n\r\nNote that because its a square matrix, the outerArray.length == innerArray.length\r\n\r\nHence to access the first element position of the inner array, and the innerArray being the first element of the outer array, I just do matrix[0][0]\r\n\r\nB> The second element (5) > which is matrix[2nd element of outer array][2nd element of inner array] > in JS code this is matrix[1][1]\r\n\r\nSo in similar way, starting from row index = 0, each element of the diagonal1 would be matrix[row][row].\r\n\r\nSo the general rule, for getting the elements of diagonal, I am incrementing both the positional values of the outer and inner array by one with each loop.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow for diagonal2\r\nC> The diagonal2 is [3, 5, 7]. So I am accessing the first element (3) >\r\n\r\nwhich is matrix[First element of outer array][Last element of inner array]  > Which is in JS code matrix[0][2]\r\n\r\nB> Then the second element of diagonal2 (i.e. 5) would be >\r\n\r\nmatrix[Second element of outer array][Last but one element of inner array]\r\n\r\nwhich is  is matrix[1][1]\r\n\r\nE> Then the second element of diagonal2 (i.e. 7) would be >\r\n\r\nmatrix[Third element of outer array][First element of inner array]\r\n\r\nwhich is  is matrix[2][0]\r\n\r\nSo the general rule, for getting the elements of diagonal, with each loop, I am incrementing the positional index values of the outer array starting from index=0; BUT for the inner array I am decrementing the positional-index values starting from innerArray.length - 1 .\r\n\r\nSo for the diagonal2, for the innerArray, the problem is of finding the element position from the last element towards left, i.e. looping the array from reverse position.\r\n\r\n**Explanation of the part matrix[row][matrix.length - row - 1]**\r\n\r\nA> Generally whenever, I have reverse-loop an array (like in the more general problems of reversing an array), starting from its last element, I do this\r\n\r\narray.[array.length - index - 1]\r\n\r\nHere, the argument \"index\" is the index of the current element being processed, ie. it will start form index=0 of the given original array.\r\n\r\nSo for the first iteration (index = 0 i.e. in this specific problem row = 0), it will give me > array.[array.length - 1 - 0] > which is the last element of the array.\r\n\r\nB> Then for the second loop, index-value (i.e. row value in this specific problem) will be 1, i.e. I am accessing the element (array.length - 1 - 1). That is the element at array.length - 2 position, i.e. the second-last position.\r\n\r\nC> And this way, for the last loop, I will be accessing array[(array.length - (length-1) - 1] element, i.e. the array[0] position's element of the original array.\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\nfunction matrixDiagonalDiff(matrix) {\r\n\r\n    let diagonal1 = 0, diagonal2 = 0;\r\n\r\n    for (let row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++) {\r\n        diagonal1 += matrix[row][row];\r\n        diagonal2 += matrix[row][matrix.length - row - 1];\r\n    }\r\n    // console.log(diagonal1 + ', ' + diagonal2);\r\n    return Math.abs(diagonal1 - diagonal2);\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet myMatrix1 = [[20, 40], [10, 60]];\r\nlet myMatrix2 = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9] ];\r\n\r\n// matrixDiagonalSums(myMatrix1);  // should output 80, 50\r\n// matrixDiagonalSums(myMatrix2); // should output 15, 15\r\n\r\n// Suboptimal Solution in O(n^2)\r\nfunction matrixDiagonalsDiff_alt(matrix) {\r\n  let diagonal1 = 0, diagonal2 = 0;\r\n\r\n  for (var i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {\r\n    for (var j = 0; j < matrix.length; j++) {\r\n      // Get elements for the main diagonal (diagonal-1).

Only then do comparison.\r\n      arr[j] = parseInt(arr[j-1])\r\n\r\n      if (currentRightEnding >= arr[j]) {\r\n        // Replace j-th position, ie. this position with that higher value of currentRightEnding. This code effectively replacing the whole array, by inserting the higher element at the j-th (i.e. (i + 1)-th ) position.\r\n        arr[j] = currentRightEnding;\r\n        break;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(\"the value of j is \" + j);\r\n\r\n    // But the above for loop will not take care of the case, when smallest no is at the right most position of the original unsorted array. Because, the loop will only run upto (n - 1) and the max i value will be (n - 1 - 1) + 1. That is the upto index-5 when n=6 . But say for example the smallest no '1' is at the 5-th position - so this will be the value of 'currentRightEnding'. And when I do if (currentRightEnding >= arr[j]) it will fail. And so assignment of 1 to index (j-1) ie. index-0 will never happen. Hence, I have to take care of this with a separate loop. But at this point here, j has reached the value of -1 after the post-decrement from the last for loop iteration. So, its just an eazy single case, to assign arr[0] if and only I have a j=-1\r\n\r\n    // And j would hit -1, because, inside the for loop the value of j is being iterated through (i + 1) all the way down to 0 . So the last iteration loop makes j's value to 0\r\n\r\n    if (j === -1) {\r\n      // console.log(\"the value of j is \" + j);\r\n      arr[0] = currentRightEnding;\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(arr.join(\" \"));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninsertionSort2(6, [1, 4, 3, 5, 6, 2]);"

It is still O(n) time ( O(2n)=O(n) ).\r\n\r\nWhat about scan n times?\r\n\r\nNo. It is O(n∗n)=O(n^2)\r\n\r\nFrom the question above, we know that, at least we could scan the array twice (or other countable number if needed.).\r\n\r\nOK, let's scan the array from start to end, e.g., [1,2,3,4]\r\n\r\nThe accumulated products can then be saved:\r\n\r\nP_forward = [1, 1*2, 1*2*3, 1*2*3*4] = [1, 2, 6, 24]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's get back to the problem, we need to get the product of all nums without current position, intuitively:\r\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4], for position 2 where nums[2] = 3, the product we want to have can be viewed:\r\n\r\nleft = 1*2\r\nright  = 4\r\n\r\np = left * right\r\n\r\nWe already have the accumulated product from our first scanning, P_forward = [1, 2, 6, 24], which means, P_forward[i] = product from 0 to i. What about the product from i+1 to end?\r\n\r\nThe backward product is computed by scanning the array backward:\r\nP_backward = [4, 4*3, 4*3*2, 4*3*2*1 ]\r\nP_backward = [4, 12, 24, 24]\r\n\r\nSO THE KEY POINT - PAUL - The significance of the P_forward is its taking care of the left side multiplication and P_backwards is taking care of the right side multiplication. And at each index position of the final result array, I have to multiply all the element of the left and all the elements on the right. Thats why I am building 2 arrays and multiplying them to get the final array.\r\n\r\n*** Note that, these products include the current element, so by adding a \"1\" in front of the product arrays will do fine: ***\r\n\r\nP_forward =    [1, 1,  2,   6,  24]\r\nP_backward =   [1, 4,  12,  24, 24]\r\n\r\nthen, the final results can be easily computed:\r\n\r\nres[0] = P_forward[0] * P_backward[3] = 24  means   (In original array -> product before [0] * product from last to [1])  i.e.  ( 1 * 24)\r\n\r\nres[1] = P_forward[1] * P_backward[2] = 12  means   (In original array -> product before [1] * product from last to [2])  i.e.  ( 1 * 12 )\r\n\r\nres[2] = P_forward[2] * P_backward[1] = 8  means  (In original array -> produce before [2] * [ product from last to [3] means [3] itself ) i.e. ( 2 * 4 )\r\n\r\nres[3] = P_forward[3] * P_backward[0] = 6  means ( In original array -> product before [3] * product after [3])  i.e. ( )\r\n\r\n\r\nFew points in the above equation\r\n\r\nA) product before [0]  >> there is nothing before [0] so, we have added just a dummy element which is 1. So product before [0] is 1\r\n\r\nB) product before [1] >> Means the first element of the original array ie. [0]\r\n\r\nres = [24, 12, 8, 6]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the problem is solved but: Lets check whether I meet the O(1) space complexity condition -\r\n\r\nP_forward can be stored in the output array\r\nP_backward is actually not necessary, each time we compute one value, multiply it to correct P_forward, then the P_backward value can be overwritten for the next computation.\r\nTherefore, we have one output array of length n (which is not count as extra space as in the question description), one int for P_backward, one int for loop. It is O(1)!\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD EXPLANATION - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB-81TB6GUc\r\n*/"

However, in a few specific cases, to avoid four characters being repeated in succession (such as IIII or XXXX), subtractive notation is often used as follows:\r\n\r\nI placed before V or X indicates one less, so four is IV (one less than 5) and 9 is IX (one less than 10).\r\nX placed before L or C indicates ten less, so forty is XL (10 less than 50) and 90 is XC (ten less than a hundred).\r\nC placed before D or M indicates a hundred less, so four hundred is CD (a hundred less than five hundred) and nine hundred is CM (a hundred less than a thousand).\r\n\r\nSo we don't require mappings for numbers 4,9,40 etc because the Roman number theory tells us if the roman numeral is IV = 5-1 = 4, hence when the prefix is smaller than the succeeding number in that case you have to subtract the former number from the succeeding number to get the actual value\r\n\r\n\r\nAlgorithm to convert Roman Numerals to Integer Number :\r\n\r\nA) Split the Roman Numeral string into Roman Symbols (character).\r\n\r\nB) Convert each symbol of Roman Numerals into the numerical value it represents.\r\n\r\nC) Take symbol one by one from starting from index 0:\r\n\r\nD) If the next-Item is bigger than then current-Item >> subtract this current-item by adding the value of next-Item to the running total.

Which is the \"Gap\" in terms of positional index value (starting from 0) between successive \"column\" elements in the same row, in the string given as the argument to the function. \r\n\r\nMeaning  in the given string \"PAYPALISHIRING\" which is in the ZigZag format, the in the first row, the Gap between first two successive elements \"P\" and \"A\" is 4 if they were arranged in the Non-ZigZag format.\r\n\r\nAnd the formulae to get periodSize or Gap is (2 * numOfRows - 2) i.e. 4 in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 -  To understand the above with a general example - \r\nhttp://www.lifeincode.net/programming/leetcode-zigzag-conversion-java/\r\n\r\nFor example, when nRows = 4, we know the ZigZag should be like the following.\r\n\r\n0        6       12       18\r\n1     5  7    11 13    17 19\r\n2  4     8 10    14 16    20\r\n3        9       15       21\r\n\r\nHere, the \"Gap\" is 6 ( 4 * 2 - 2). In the formmulae ( numRows * 2 -2 ) the subtracting, 2 indicates there there  are no numbers between the 4-number column in the first line and last line. And there is only one number between 4-number column in other lines. \r\n\r\nThat is, without a ZigZag, from sequentially going from the first element of the first row, which is \"0\" here, to the second element of the first row (which is \"6\") here, I had to traverse 4 element down and then 4 elements up, giving me a Gap of 8. But because of the way Zigzag is formed, I am skipping the 2 inbetween number / positions. Hence the deduction by 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 - The solution accumulates, the next element in each row one by one. So first it takes the starting character of the given string (i.e.  s.charAt(0) ). Then the next character to add would be at position (0 + periodSize) ie. at charCode(4) , which is \"A\" here.\r\n\r\nThen the third character to add would be at position ( 0 + periodSize + periodSize ) i.e charCode(8) which is \"H\" here. \r\n\r\nIn this way we get the first row \"PAHN\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5  - But for the middle rows we have to start a second iterartion loop. Because, in the first and the last row the number of characters will be eaxtly equal to the size of the \"period\"/\"cycles\" - that is one element for each column. That is, there is no element between the \"column\" elements.\r\n\r\nBut in all the middle rows, we have to insert one element between the \"column\" elements. This is resulting from the way a a ZigZag is formed by the ZigZag movement. \r\n\r\n\r\n6 -  When we go into the middle loop with i - 1  >> At this step of the iteration, each of the j and secondJ value will be calculated sequentially and added to result.\r\n\r\n\r\n7  -  for i (no of rows or row index ) when the second iteration starts, that is i = 1 >> the variable j takes that value for the first iteration (as j = i in the for loop) and adds that character to result. Thats why immediately after \"PAHN\" (the value of result after first iteration), I am getting \"A\" as the value of j and which is being added to result.\r\n\r\nBut now, the the code for the mniddle row starts, as the condition ( i !==0 && i !== numRows -1) satisfies. So, after j is assigned the value of \"A\" the secondJ calculation will be executed and added to the result till now. \r\n\r\n8 -  We only visit each character in s once. So the complexity is only O(n).\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\nvar convert = function(s, numRows) {\t\r\n\tvar periodSize = (numRows * 2) - 2;\r\n\tvar len = s.length;\r\n\tvar result = '';\r\n\tvar i, j, secondJ;\r\n\r\n\tif (numRows === 1) {\r\n\t\treturn s;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tfor (i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {\r\n\t\tfor (j = i; j < len; j += periodSize) {\r\n\t\t\tresult += s.charAt(j);\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// For middle rows\r\n\t\t\tif (i !== 0 && i !== (numRows - 1)) {\r\n\t\t\t\tsecondJ = (j + periodSize ) - (2 * i);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tif (secondJ < len) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tresult += s.charAt(secondJ);\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t// console.log(\"index value of j is \" + j);\r\n\t\t\t\t// console.log(\"index value of sedondJ is \" + secondJ);\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn result;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nconsole.log(convert(\"PAYPALISHIRING\", 3)); // should return \"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR\"\r\n\r\n/*\r\nconvert('ABCDEF', 4) should return 'ABFCED'\r\n    Row 1 ->  A\r\n    Row 2 ->    B       F\r\n    Row 3 ->      C   E\r\n    Row 4 ->        D\r\n*/\r\n// console.log(convert('ABCDEF', 4));\r\n\r\n\r\n/* \r\nconvert('ABCDEF', 2) should returns 'ACEBDF'\r\nRow 1 ->  A   C   E\r\nRow 2 ->    B   D   F\r\n*/\r\n// console.log(convert('ABCDEF', 2));"

Correct Ans - Result: 6857 */\r\n\r\n/*\r\nSolution : As we learned a number is called prime factor if it is prime number and it can divide the number exactly. Another property of prime factor is that if we keep dividing the number by prime factor then it will either fully divide the number or produce another prime factor e.g. if we need to find the prime factors of 16 then starting from 2 if keep dividing, eventually dividend become 1, so 2 is the only prime factor of 16. On other hand if need to find prime factor of 15, then we first try to divide it by 2, but since its not divisible by 2, we move to next number which is 3. Since 3 can divide 15, it produces another prime number 5, now 5 is not divisible by anything other than 5, so 3 and 5 become prime factor of 15.\r\n\r\nAlgorithm : In our program, we have used the same logic. We start with 2, the smallest prime number and try to divide the number, if number is divisible then we keep dividing it by same number until its not divisible any more. Now we move to next number, the largest number which is able to fully divide the input is our largest prime factor.\r\n\r\nhttps://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/03/how-to-find-largest-prime-factor-of.html\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\nlargestPrimeFactor = n => {\r\n\r\n    // start with the smallest prime 2\r\n    let i = 2;\r\n\r\n    while (n > i) {\r\n        if (n % i === 0) {\r\n            n = n / i\r\n        }\r\n        i++\r\n    }\r\nreturn i;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconsole.log(largestPrimeFactor(600851475143));"

It’s common to create a single change handler to handle changes to all form fields. It may look something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```JS\r\nupdateState(event) {\r\n const {name, value} = event.target;\r\n let user = this.state.user; // this is a reference, not a copy...\r\n user[name] = value; // so this mutates state 🙀\r\n return this.setState({user});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI’m using ES6 object shorthand on line 5 — you can omit the right-hand side when the left-hand side matches.\r\n\r\nThe concern is on line 4. Line 4 actually mutates state because the user variable is a reference to state. React state should be treated as immutable.\r\n\r\nFrom the React docs:\r\n\r\nNever mutate this.state directly, as calling setState() afterwards may replace the mutation you made. Treat this.state as if it were immutable.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nsetState batches work behind the scenes. This means a manual state mutation may be overridden when setState is processed.\r\nIf you declare a shouldComponentUpdate method, you can’t use a === equality check inside because the object reference will not change. So the approach above has a potential performance impact as well.\r\nBottom line: The example above often works okay, but to avoid edge cases, treat state as immutable.\r\n\r\n*/"

Even more fundamentally, In computer science (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application), partial application (or partial function application) refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity. Given a function {\\displaystyle f\\colon (X\\times Y\\times Z)\\to N}{\\displaystyle f\\colon (X\\times Y\\times Z)\\to N}, we might fix (or 'bind') the first argument, producing a function of type {\\displaystyle {\\text{partial}}(f)\\colon (Y\\times Z)\\to N}{\\displaystyle {\\text{partial}}(f)\\colon (Y\\times Z)\\to N}.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://benalman.com/news/2012/09/partial-application-in-javascript/#partial-application\r\n\r\nPartial application can be described as taking a function that accepts some number of arguments, binding values to one or more of those arguments, and returning a new function that only accepts the remaining, un-bound arguments.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that, given any arbitrary function, a new function can be generated that has one or more arguments \"bound,\" or partially applied.\r\n\r\nJavaScript has the built-in method .bindthat works on functions with any number of arguments and can bind an arbitrary amount of parameters. Its invocation has the following syntax.\r\n\r\nfunction.bind(thisValue, [arg1], [arg2], ...)\r\n\r\nIt turns function into a new function whose implicit this parameter is this value and whose initial arguments are always as given.\r\n\r\nfunction addition(x, y) {\r\n   return x + y;\r\n}\r\nconst plus5 = addition.bind(null, 5)\r\nplus5(10) // output -> 15\r\n\r\nNote: this value does not matter for the (non-method) function addition which is why it is null above.\r\n\r\nPartial application is the act of taking a function which takes multiple arguments, and “locking in” some of those arguments, producing a function which takes fewer arguments.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\nhttps://medium.com/@JosephJnk/partial-function-application-in-javascript-and-flow-7f3ca87074fe\r\n\r\nFor instance, say we have this function:\r\n\r\nfunction power(exponent: number, base: number) : number {\r\n  let result = 1;\r\n  for (let i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {\r\n    result = result * base;\r\n  }\r\n  return result;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can use this to raise numbers to some power, like doing power(2, 3) to see that 3 squared is 9, or power(3, 2) to see that 2 cubed is 8. It would be more readable to just say square(3) or cube(2), though. To do this, we want to produce a function that’s the result of “locking-in” 2 and 3 to power. We can do this by manually declaring new functions:\r\n\r\nconst square = x => power(2, x)\r\nconst cube = x => power(3, x)\r\n\r\nThis is partial application: we create square by making a new function, which just passes its arguments through to another function, adding some hard-coded arguments to that other function. We could be more explicit in our intent by making a partialApply function that produces these new functions for us:\r\n\r\nconst square = partialApply(power, 2);\r\nconst cube = partialApply(power, 3);\r\n\r\nThis partialApply function is quite easy to write, because it turns out that partial application is baked into JavaScript:\r\n\r\nfunction partialApply (fn, ...args) {\r\n  return fn.bind(null, ...args)\r\n}\r\n\r\nNote, the arguments (i.e. ...args) that I am passing will start from left to right in the function that will be invoked (ie. fn) So in this case of\r\n\r\nconst square = x => partialApply(power, 2)\r\n\r\nThe number 2 will be applied from left to right, i.e. 2 becomes the first argument (exponent ) to the the power() function\r\n\r\n\r\n*/\r\n"

For example,\r\n\r\n- lodash - [`cloneDeep`](https://lodash.com/docs#cloneDeep); can be imported separately via the [lodash.clonedeep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.clonedeep) module and is probably your best choice if you're not already using a library that provides a deep cloning function\r\n- AngularJS - [`angular.copy`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.copy)\r\n- jQuery - [`jQuery.extend(true, { }, oldObject)`](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/#jQuery-extend-deep-target-object1-objectN); `.clone()` only clones DOM elements\r\n\r\n# ES6\r\n\r\nFor completeness, note that ES6 offers two shallow copy mechanisms: [`Object.assign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) and the [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax).\r\nwhich copies values of all enumerable own properties from one object to another. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar A1 = {a: \"2\"};\r\nvar A2 = Object.assign({}, A1);\r\nvar A3 = {...A1};  // Spread Syntax\r\n```\r\n"

If the source value is a reference to an object, it only copies that reference value to the target object.\r\n\r\nA shallow copy will duplicate the top-level properties, but the nested object is shared between the original(source) and the copy(target). Lets see an example\r\n\r\nAnd what is meant by Deep copy -\r\n\r\nA deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.\r\n\r\nLets take an example\r\nShallow Copy: It makes a copy of the reference to X into Y. Think about it as a copy of X’s Address. So, the addresses of X and Y will be the same i.e. they will be pointing to the same memory location.\r\n\r\nDeep copy: It makes a copy of all the members of X, allocates different memory location for Y and then assigns the copied members to Y to achieve deep copy. In this way, if X vanishes Y is still valid in the memory.\r\n\r\nSo with deep-copy the 2 objects are stored as two different locations in the memory space).\r\n */\r\n\r\n// First reassign the value of myObj_1.a to a new value\r\nmyObj_1.a = 10;\r\n\r\n// console.log(myObj_1) // => { a: 10, b: 5, c: { x: 7, y: 4 } }    // i.e. a has changed\r\n// console.log(clone_1_nested)  // => { a: 2, b: 5, c: { x: 7, y: 4 } }  // but that change in the original a has not affected the value of a in the cloned object. This is how I want my clone to behave. But this will not be case for the nested cloned object.\r\n\r\n// Reassign the value of myObj_1.c.x to a new value\r\nmyObj_1.c.x = 17;\r\n\r\n// console.log(myObj_1) // => { a: 10, b: 5, c: { x: 17, y: 4 } }    // i.e. a has changed\r\n// console.log(clone_1_nested)  // => { a: 2, b: 5, c: { x: 17, y: 4 } }\r\n// but that change in the original c.x has now will affect the cloned object as well, because the cloned is referencing the same value.\r\n\r\n// Both clone_1_nested.c.x and myObj.c.x share the same reference to the object because of individual copies were not made, instead a reference to the object was copied. Any change made to any of the object's nested object-property applies to all references using the object.\r\n\r\n/* PROBLEM - 2 - Properties on the prototype chain and non-enumerable properties cannot be copied. */\r\n\r\nlet prototypeObj = {\r\n    a: 2\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet myObj = Object.create(prototypeObj, {\r\n    b: {\r\n        value: 2\r\n    },\r\n    c: {\r\n        value: 3,\r\n        enumerable: true\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n\r\nlet shallowCloned = Object.assign({}, myObj)\r\n\r\n// console.log(shallowCloned)  //  => { c: 3 }\r\n\r\n/* EXPLANATION\r\n\r\nprototypeObj is on obj's prototype chain so it wouldn't be copied.\r\nproperty b is a non-enumerable property.

Primitives like strings and numbers are compared by their value, while objects like arrays, dates, and user defined objects are compared by their reference. This means it compares whether two objects are referring to the same location in memory.\r\n\r\nAnswer: Equality check will check whether two objects have same value for same property. To check that, you can get the keys for both the objects. If the number of properties doesn't match, these two objects are not equal. Secondly, you will check each property whether they have the same value. If all the properties have same value, they are equal.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction isEqual(a, b) {\r\n  var aProps = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(a),\r\n    bProps = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(b)\r\n\r\n  if (aProps.length != bProps.length) {\r\n    return false\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  for (var i = 0; i < aProps.length; i++) {\r\n    var propName = aProps[i]\r\n\r\n    if (a[propName] !== b[propName]) {\r\n      return false\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLimitation:\r\nIf one of the property values is itself an object\r\nIf one of the property values is NaN (the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself?)\r\nIf one object has a property with value undefined, while another object doesn't have the property (which thus evaluates as undefined). Btw, you can solve this problem by using hasOwnProperty\r\n\r\nref: [object equality in JS](http://designpepper.com/blog/drips/object-equality-in-javascript.html), [Underscore.js isEqual function](http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html#section-90)\r\n"

Write a function memoize() which takes a function as an argument and subsequent calls to the memoized function with the same arguments are fast\r\n\r\n```js\r\nslowFunc(params) // slow output\r\nmemoizedFunc = memoize(slowFunc)\r\nmemoizedFunc(params) // slow output\r\nmemoizedFunc(params) // fast output\r\nmemoizedFunc(params) // fast output\r\nmemoizedFunc(newParams) // slow output\r\nmemoizedFunc(newParams) // fast output\r\n```\r\n\r\nThought process Pseudocode\r\nWe are basically creating a higher order function, which is a function which returns another function, so out memoize function will be of the following type\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction memoize(fn) {\r\n  return function () {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks to closures we can have a cache object, which can be accessed by the outputted function too.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction memoize(fn) {\r\n  const cache = {}\r\n  return function () {\r\n    // cache can be used here too\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we have to keep a check on the arguments, the cache key can be the arguments\r\nFor subsequent calls if the cache key exists, we simply return it or else we compute the value and store in cache\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction memoize(fn) {\r\n  const cache = {}\r\n  return function () {\r\n    const args = JSON.stringify(arguments)\r\n    if (cache[args]) {\r\n      return cache[args]\r\n    }\r\n    const evaluatedValue = fn.apply(this, arguments)\r\n    cache[args] = evaluatedValue\r\n    return evaluatedValue\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nfunction factorial(n) {\r\n  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {\r\n    return 1\r\n  }\r\n  return factorial(n - 1) * n\r\n}\r\nconst memoizedFactorial = memoize(factorial)\r\nmemoizedFactorial(1000) // slow\r\nmemoizedFactorial(1000) // faster\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Caveat-\r\n\r\nThis can be a memory intensive technique, and should not be overused.\r\n"

You can also take a look at the\r\nObject.preventExtensions() method to go deeper into the topic of object immutability. As a bonus, take a look at the speed test for both methods at jsPerf.\r\n\r\n### Reading\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/@wlodarczyk_j/object-freeze-vs-object-seal-ba6d7553a436*/\r\n"

Therefore it assigns properties, versus copying or defining new properties.\r\n\r\n#### Simple use-case for merging multiple objects\r\n\r\n`Object.assign(target, source_1, ..., source_n)`\r\n\r\nThis function modifies target and returns it: it first copies all enumerable own properties of source_1 to target, then those of source_2, etc.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Latest ES6\r\nconst obj1 = {\r\n  a: 1,\r\n  b: 2,\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst obj2 = {\r\n  c: 3,\r\n  d: 4,\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst merged = { ...obj1, ...obj2 }\r\n\r\n// console.log(merged); // => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }s\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### The following example uses the Object.assign() method to clone an object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet widget = {\r\n  color: \"red\",\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet clonedWidget = Object.assign({}, widget)\r\n\r\nconsole.log(clonedWidget)\r\n/* Output\r\n\r\n{\r\n  color: \"red\"\r\n} */\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Adding a method to an object\r\n\r\n```js\r\nMyClass.prototype.foo = function(arg1, arg2) {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nECMAScript 6 has a more concise syntax for methods [3]. Thanks to Object.assign(), you don’t have to abandon that syntax:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nObject.assign(MyClass.prototype, {\r\n  foo(arg1, arg2) {\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n\r\n```\r\n"

            "content": "## What is attributes (or) descriptors of an object\r\n\r\nEach property of an object is more than just a name and value. To understand this, let’s consider a simple book object. The primordial Object constructor has a method which let’s us view all the descriptors of any property of an object. For example, you can view the descriptors of the property 'title' of the 'book' object by calling as below\r\n\r\n```JS\r\n\r\nlet book ={\r\n    title: \"JavaScript Allongé\",\r\n    author: \"Reginald Braithwaite\"\r\n};\r\n\r\nconsole.log(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(book, 'title'))\r\n```\r\nThe following will be the OUTPUT\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{ value: 'JavaScript Allongé',\r\n  writable: true,\r\n  enumerable: true,\r\n  configurable: true }\r\n```\r\nHere, we can see that the property 'title' itself has four more descriptors namely value, writable, enumerable and configurable. And their values are true by default.\r\n\r\n## Writable:\r\n\r\nWritable is probably the simplest. It’s value indicates whether the property’s value can be changed. We can set the writable value by making use of Object function’s defineProperty method:\r\n\r\n``Object.defineProperty(book, 'title', {writable: false}) ``\r\n\r\nThis makes the brand property non-writable. And now if we try to change brand value, for example, by saying car[brand] = ‘Maserati’, it would throw an exception.\r\n\r\nNote: ‘use strict’ needs to be enabled for the JavaScript to actually acknowledge the exception.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the property value is itself an another object (i.e. nested object), this will not work. To illustrate this, let’s add another property dimension to the car object with an object as it’s value as shown below.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet book ={\r\n    title: \"JavaScript Allongé\",\r\n    author: \"Reginald Braithwaite\"\r\n    specification: {\r\n        pages: 252\r\n        yearPublished: 2018\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n'specification' here is just a reference and JavaScript only prevents us from changing this reference and will not stop us from changing the properties of the object that this reference points to. To make the object itself non-writable we can use Object’s freeze method as follows:\r\n\r\n``Object.freeze(book.specification);``\r\n\r\n## Enumerable:\r\n\r\nThe enumerable descriptor is quite powerful and useful in cases where you don’t want to loop over certain properties. The enumerable descriptor, when set to false on a property will hide it when looping over all properties using for…in loop. It also hides the property from the list of keys as obtained by Object.keys(car) and will not show up during JSON serialization with JSON.stringify(car) as well. To set dimension to false, we do:\r\n\r\n``Object.defineProperty(book, 'specification', {enumerable: false})``\r\n\r\n## Configurable:\r\n\r\nOnce configurable property is set to false, it locks down that property and prevents from modifying enumerable and even configurable. It also prevents from deleting that property. However, writable can still be modified. To lock down brand we can do:\r\n\r\n``Object.defineProperty(book, {configurable: false})``"

It is highly recommended.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/130652/kangax\r\n[2]: http://perfectionkills.com/understanding-delete/\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solution-2\r\n\r\n    var myObject = {\"ircEvent\": \"PRIVMSG\", \"method\": \"newURI\", \"regex\": \"^http://.*\"};\r\n\r\n    delete myObject.regex;\r\n\r\n    console.log ( myObject.regex); // logs: undefined\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solution-3\r\n\r\nThe `delete` operator is used to remove properties from objects.\r\n\r\n    const obj = { foo: \"bar\" }\r\n    delete obj.foo\r\n    obj.hasOwnProperty(\"foo\") // false\r\n\r\nNote that, for arrays, **this is not the same as removing an element**. To remove an element from an array, use `Array#splice` or `Array#pop`. For example:\r\n\r\n    arr // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\r\n    arr.splice(3,1); // 3\r\n    arr // [0, 1, 2, 4]\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\n`delete` in JavaScript has a different function to that of the keyword in C and C++: it does not directly free memory. Instead, its sole purpose is to remove properties from objects.\r\n\r\nFor arrays, deleting a property corresponding to an index, creates a sparse array (ie. an array with a \"hole\" in it). Most browsers represent these missing array indices as \"empty\".\r\n\r\n    var array = [0, 1, 2, 3]\r\n    delete array[2] // [0, 1, empty, 3]\r\n\r\nNote that `delete` does not relocate `array[3]` into `array[2]`.\r\n\r\nDifferent built-in functions in JavaScript handle sparse arrays differently.\r\n\r\n- `for...in` will skip the empty index completely.\r\n\r\n- A traditional `for` loop will return `undefined` for the value at the index.\r\n\r\n- Any method using `Symbol.iterator` will return `undefined` for the value at the index.\r\n\r\n- `forEach`, `map` and `reduce` will simply skip the missing index.\r\n\r\nSo, the `delete` operator should not be used for the common use-case of removing elements from an array. Arrays have a dedicated methods for removing elements and reallocating memory: `Array#splice()` and `Array#pop`.\r\n\r\n## Array#splice(start[, deleteCount[, item1[, item2[, ...]]]])\r\n\r\n`Array#splice` mutates the array, and returns any removed indices. `deleteCount` elements are removed from index `start`, and `item1, item2... itemN` are inserted into the array from index `start`. If `deleteCount` is omitted then elements from startIndex are removed to the end of the array.\r\n\r\n    let a = [0,1,2,3,4]\r\n    a.splice(2,2) // returns the removed elements [2,3]\r\n    // ...and `a` is now [0,1,4]\r\n\r\nThere is also a similarly named, but different, function on `Array.prototype`: `Array#slice`.\r\n\r\n## Array#slice([begin[, end]])\r\n\r\n`Array#slice` is non-destructive, and returns a new array containing the indicated indices from `start` to `end`. If `end` is left unspecified, it defaults to the end of the array. If `end` is positive, it specifies the zero-based **non-inclusive** index to stop at. If `end` is negative it, it specifies the index to stop at by counting back from the end of the array (eg. -1 will omit the final index). If `end <= start`, the result is an empty array.\r\n\r\n    let a = [0,1,2,3,4]\r\n    let slices = [\r\n        a.slice(0,2),\r\n        a.slice(2,2),\r\n        a.slice(2,3),\r\n        a.slice(2,5) ]\r\n\r\n    //   a           [0,1,2,3,4]\r\n    //   slices[0]   [0 1]- - -\r\n    //   slices[1]    - - - - -\r\n    //   slices[2]    - -[3]- -\r\n    //   slices[3]    - -[2 4 5]\r\n\r\n# Array#pop\r\n\r\n`Array#pop` removes the last element from an array, and returns that element. This operation changes the length of the array.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solution-4\r\n\r\nThe term you have used in your question title `Remove a property from a JavaScript object`, can be interpreted in some different ways. The one is to remove it for whole the memory and the list of object keys or the other is just to remove it from your object. As it has been mentioned in some other answers, the `delete` keyword is the main part. Let's say you have your object like:\r\n\r\n    myJSONObject = {\"ircEvent\": \"PRIVMSG\", \"method\": \"newURI\", \"regex\": \"^http://.*\"};\r\n\r\nIf you do:\r\n\r\n    console.log(Object.keys(myJSONObject));\r\n\r\nthe result would be:\r\n\r\n    [\"ircEvent\", \"method\", \"regex\"]\r\n\r\nYou can delete that specific key from your object keys like:\r\n\r\n    delete myJSONObject[\"regex\"];\r\n\r\nThen your objects key using `Object.keys(myJSONObject)` would be:\r\n\r\n    [\"ircEvent\", \"method\"]\r\n\r\nBut the point is if you care about memory and you want to whole the object gets removed from the memory, it is recommended to set it to null before you delete the key:\r\n\r\n    myJSONObject[\"regex\"] = null;\r\n    delete myJSONObject[\"regex\"];\r\n\r\nThe other important point here is to be careful about your other references to the same object. For instance, if you create a variable like:\r\n\r\n    var regex = myJSONObject[\"regex\"];\r\n\r\nOr add it as a new pointer to another object like:\r\n\r\n    var myOtherObject = {};\r\n    myOtherObject[\"regex\"] = myJSONObject[\"regex\"];\r\n\r\nThen even if you remove it from your object `myJSONObject`, that specific object won't get deleted from the memory, since the `regex` variable and `myOtherObject[\"regex\"]` still have their values. Then how could we remove the object from the memory for sure?\r\n\r\nThe answer would be to **delete all the references you have in your code, pointed to that very object** and also **not use `var` statements to create new references to that object**. This last point regarding `var` statements, is one of the most crucial issues that we are usually faced with, because using `var` statements would prevent the created object from getting removed.\r\n\r\nWhich means in this case you won't be able to remove that object because you have created the `regex` variable via a `var` statement, and if you do:\r\n\r\n    delete regex; //False\r\n\r\nThe result would be `false`, which means that your delete statement haven't been executed as you expected. But if you had not created that variable before, and you only had `myOtherObject[\"regex\"]` as your last existing reference, you could have done this just by removing it like:\r\n\r\n    myOtherObject[\"regex\"] = null;\r\n    delete myOtherObject[\"regex\"];\r\n\r\n**In other words, a JavaScript object gets killed as soon as there is no reference left in your code pointed to that object.**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\nThanks to @AgentME:\r\n\r\n> Setting a property to null before deleting it doesn't accomplish\r\n> anything (unless the object has been sealed by Object.seal and the\r\n> delete fails. That's not usually the case unless you specifically\r\n> try).\r\n\r\nTo get more info on `Object.seal`: [Object.seal()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/seal)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solution-5\r\n\r\nObjects in JavaScript can be thought of as maps between keys and values. The `delete` operator is used to remove these keys, more commonly known as object properties, one at a time.\r\n\r\n    var obj = {\r\n      myProperty: 1\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('myProperty')) // true\r\n    delete obj.myProperty\r\n    console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('myProperty')) // false\r\n\r\nThe `delete` operator does not directly free memory, and it differs from simply assigning the value of `null` or `undefined` to a property, in that the property _itself_ is removed from the object. Note that if the _value_ of a deleted property was a reference type (an object), and another part of your program still holds a reference to that object, then that object will, of course, not be garbage collected until all references to it have disappeared.\r\n\r\n`delete` will only work on properties whose descriptor marks them as configurable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solutlion-6\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to use the [Underscore.js][1] library.\r\n\r\nNote that `_.pick()` and `_.omit()` both return a copy of the object and don't directly modify the original object. Assigning the result to the original object should do the trick (not shown).\r\n\r\nReference: [link][2] **\\_.pick(object, \\*keys)**\r\n\r\nReturn a copy of the object, filtered to only have values for the\r\nwhitelisted keys (or array of valid keys).\r\n\r\n    var myJSONObject =\r\n    {\"ircEvent\": \"PRIVMSG\", \"method\": \"newURI\", \"regex\": \"^http://.*\"};\r\n\r\n    _.pick(myJSONObject, \"ircEvent\", \"method\");\r\n    => {\"ircEvent\": \"PRIVMSG\", \"method\": \"newURI\"};\r\n\r\nReference: [link][3] **\\_.omit(object, \\*keys)**\r\n\r\nReturn a copy of the object, filtered to omit the\r\nblacklisted keys (or array of keys).\r\n\r\n    var myJSONObject =\r\n    {\"ircEvent\": \"PRIVMSG\", \"method\": \"newURI\", \"regex\": \"^http://.*\"};\r\n\r\n    _.omit(myJSONObject, \"regex\");\r\n    => {\"ircEvent\": \"PRIVMSG\", \"method\": \"newURI\"};\r\n\r\nFor arrays, `_.filter()` and `_.reject()` can be used in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://underscorejs.org\r\n[2]: http://underscorejs.org/#pick\r\n[3]: http://underscorejs.org/#omit\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solution-7\r\n\r\nWith `unset` function\r\n\r\nThe reason for writing this with new `unset` function, is to keep the index of all other variables in this hash_map. Look at the following example, and see how the index of \"test2\" did not change after removing a value from the hash_map.\r\n\r\n    function unset(unsetKey, unsetArr, resort){\r\n      var tempArr = unsetArr;\r\n      var unsetArr = {};\r\n      delete tempArr[unsetKey];\r\n      if(resort){\r\n        j = -1;\r\n      }\r\n      for(i in tempArr){\r\n        if(typeof(tempArr[i]) !== 'undefined'){\r\n          if(resort){\r\n            j++;\r\n          }else{\r\n            j = i;\r\n          }\r\n          unsetArr[j] = tempArr[i];\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      return unsetArr;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var unsetArr = ['test','deletedString','test2'];\r\n\r\n    console.log(unset('1',unsetArr,true)); // output Object {0: \"test\", 1: \"test2\"}\r\n    console.log(unset('1',unsetArr,false)); // output Object {0: \"test\", 2: \"test2\"}\r\n\r\n---\r\n"

The current context (object) is is not always what you expect. It can change what it references when a function is passed to other objects.Without a containing object, `this` refers to the global scope (window). Understanding `this` is crucial to writing solid object oriented JavaScript and will punish those who don’t understand it.\r\n\r\n#### examples:\r\n\r\nWhen there is no other containing scope `this` is `window`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction someFunction() {\r\n  console.log(this);\r\n}\r\nsomeFunction(); // window\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn nested anonymous functions `this` is still `window`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n(function() {\r\n    console.log(this); // logs window\r\n    (function() {\r\n        console.log(this); // logs window\r\n    })();\r\n})();\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn an Object: `this` refers to the containing object:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar object = {\r\n    someMethod: function() {\r\n        console.log(this)\r\n    }\r\n};\r\nobject.someMethod(); // logs object\r\nobject[\"someMethod\"](); // logs object\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen functions change scope: `this` becomes the new scope:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar object = {\r\n    someMethod: function() {\r\n        console.log(this)\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar someMethod = object.someMethod;\r\nsomeMethod(); // logs window\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can force a function to use a give context use call or apply and pass the context:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar object = {};\r\n\r\nvar someFunction = function() {\r\n  console.log(this);\r\n  console.log(arguments);\r\n};\r\n\r\nsomeFunction.call(object, 'arg1', 'arg2'); // logs object then arg1 and arg2\r\n\r\n// is the same as\r\nsomeFunction.apply(object, ['arg1', 'arg2']); // logs object then arg1 and arg2\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can pass on object to apply to bind the function's context to that object:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar object = {};\r\n\r\nvar someFunction = function() { console.log(this); };\r\n\r\nvar boundFunction = function() {\r\n  return someFunction.apply(object, arguments);\r\n};\r\n\r\nboundFunction(); // logs object\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nMost modern browsers support binding functions natively with the bind method:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nvar object = {};\r\n\r\nvar someFunction = function() { console.log(this); };\r\n\r\nvar boundFunction = someFunction.bind(object);\r\n\r\nboundFunction(); // logs object\r\n```\r\n\r\nLodash and other libraries provide context binding for browsers that don't support binding:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar object = {};\r\nvar someFunction = function() { console.log(this); };\r\nvar boundFunction = _.bind(someFunction, object);\r\nvar proxyBound = $.proxy(someFunction, object);\r\nboundFunction(); // logs object\r\nproxyBound(); // logs object"

With arrow functions however, this is lexically bound. It means that it uses `this` from the code that contains the arrow function.\r\n\r\nWhich would mean that whenever 'this' would be referred in arrow function, it will start looking up the scope to find the value of this, or in this case, during look up it found, that the object named 'profile' is not having a 'this' of it's own. Hence, it went upto global scope, and binded to the value of 'this' from global scope, where it wont find anything for 'this.name'.

It uses the value of 'this' from the surrounding code for its context. i.e. whatever 'this' points to in the surrounding code, this will point to in the function body of the fat arrow function.\r\n// So in the below solution, I am not using any 'this' at all\r\n\r\nconst profile_2 = {\r\n  name: \"tech\",\r\n\r\n  getName: () => {\r\n    console.log(this);\r\n    console.log(profile.name);\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\n// profile_2.getName()\r\n/*OUTPUT\r\n\r\n{}\r\ntech\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n// ALTERNATIVE - 2 - To fix the above problem, i.e. WHILE KEEPING THE ARROW SYNTAX OUTPUT THE EXPECTED OUPUT\r\n\r\n// Declare a global variable so all the functions defined in this file will always have access to this variable\r\n// And then inside the function dont use any 'this' at ll.\r\nvar name = \"paul\";\r\n\r\nconst profile_3 = {\r\n  name: \"tech\",\r\n\r\n  getName: () => {\r\n    console.log(name);\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nprofile_3.getName();\r\n\r\n/*\r\nFURTHER EXPLANATION\r\n\r\n1> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38589227/why-this-is-undefined-inside-a-fat-arrow-function-definition\r\n\r\n2> https://github.com/anirudh-modi/JS-essentials/blob/master/ES2015/Functions/Arrow%20functions.md#how-this-is-different-for-arrow-functions\r\n\r\n3> https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/ch1.md\r\n*/\r\n"

Additionally, we don’t have to list all the properties of an object if we only need one or two.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(age, name, hobbies);    // => 25 'Luke' 'music'\r\n\r\nconsole.log(hobbies, name, age);    // => music Luke 25\r\n\r\nconsole.log(hobbies, name);    // => music Luke\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### General Array Destructuring Example\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet arr = [‘Jim’, ‘Bob’, ‘Sarah’, ‘Cassie’];\r\n\r\nlet [ jim, bob, sarah, cassie ] = arr;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(jim, bob, sarah, cassie); //outputs: Jim Bob Sarah Cassie\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Unlike objects, the name we give the variables doesn’t matter. Let’s change the above example:  So, each of the variable names will ONLY count for the index-positions I fetch.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet arr = [‘Jim’, ‘Bob’, ‘Sarah’, ‘Cassie’];\r\n\r\nlet [ var1, var2, var3, var4] = arr;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(var1, var2, var3, var4); //outputs: Jim Bob Sarah Cassie\r\n```\r\n\r\n### If I include less variables then there are indexes in the arrays, then just like in Object-destructuring, only that many array element will be included in the returned array, starting from zero-index position and AGAIN without giving any meaning to the the name I give to the variables. So, each of the variable names will ONLY count for the index-positions I fetch.\r\n\r\nlet arr = [‘Jim’, ‘Bob’, ‘Sarah’, ‘Cassie’];\r\n\r\nlet [ jim, bob, cassie ] = arr;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(jim, bob, cassie); //outputs: Jim Bob Sarah\r\n\r\n## Using Spread operator -  It is often used for splitting out a part of an object, but keeping the remaining properties in another object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet myObj = {\r\n\r\n    name: \"Luke\",\r\n    age: 25,\r\n    hobbies: \"music\"\r\n\r\n};\r\n\r\nlet { hobbies, ...rest } = myObj;  // => Luke 25 music\r\n\r\nconsole.log(hobbies, rest)  // => music { name: 'Luke', age: 25 }\r\n\r\nconsole.log(hobbies, rest.age)  // => music 25\r\n\r\n```"

That’s because any error that occurs in the Promise chain will stop further execution and an error will end up in the next .catch() in the chain.\r\n\r\nA friendly reminder: just like with callback based APIs, this is still asynchronous operations. The code that is executed when the request has finished — that is, the subsequent .then() calls — is put on the event loop just like a callback function would be.

If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function.  However, if the data is not cached, then the function is executed, and the result is added to the cache.\r\n\r\nIn the example, a self-executing anonymous function returns an inner function, f(), which is used as the Fibonacci function. When f() is returned, its closure allows it to continue to access the “memo” object, which stores all of its previous results. Each time f() is executed, it first checks to see if a result exists for the current value of “n”. If it does, then the cached value is returned. Otherwise, the original Fibonacci code is executed. Note that “memo” is defined outside of f() so that it can retain its value over multiple function calls. Recall that the original recursive function was called over 40 billion times to compute the 50th Fibonacci number. By implementing memoization, this number drops to 99.\r\n\r\n\r\nB> http://lucasfcosta.com/2016/01/25/Understanding-and-Applying-Memoization.html\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\nlet fIndex = 10;\r\nlet timesCalculated = 0\r\n\r\nfibonacci = num => {\r\n  timesCalculated++;\r\n\r\n  if (num < 2 ) return num;\r\n  else\r\n    return fibonacci(num - 1) + fibonacci( num - 2);\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet startTime = Date.now();\r\nconsole.log('Result ' + fibonacci(fIndex));\r\nlet endTime = Date.now();\r\n\r\nconsole.log('Elapsed Time ' + (endTime - startTime) + 'ms');;\r\nconsole.log('Calculated Fibonacci ' + timesCalculated + ' times');\r\n\r\n/* When calling our fibonacci function with 5 as an argument, for example, this is what happens:\r\n\r\n  1> Our function calls fibonacci(4) and fibonacci(3), because the 5th Fibonacci number is equal to the 4th + 3rd numbers.\r\n  2> Each of these calls does the same thing, asking for the sum of the two fibonacci numbers immediately before\r\n  3> When asking for fibonacci(1) or fibonacci(0) the function will return the argument value itself\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n// NOW IMPLEMENTING MEMOIZATION\r\n/* Basically, it does the same thing as before, it is still recursive, but this time, instead of calling itself and calculating a new result for every number, it checks if that input has already been used and then, if it was, it retrieves the result for that.\r\n\r\nFor this to work, I just had to create an object called 'resultsCache' which has key/value pairs in which the key is the input provided for the function (the 'num' variable ) that calculates the fibonacci number and the value is its result.

By convention, 1 is considered to be ugly number.\r\n*/\r\n\r\n/* Solution Algo - To check if a number is ugly, divide the number by greatest divisible powers of 2, 3 and 5, if the number becomes 1 then it is an ugly number otherwise not.\r\n\r\nLet's take an example : N=9000 (We want to check this number is ugly or not) , but for that we have to check it by dividing N by the Greatest Divisible Power of prime ( 2,3 or 5) : \r\nN=9000 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^3\r\nSo, GDP of 2 becomes - 2^3 = 8\r\nGDP of 3 becomes - 3^2 = 9 \r\nGDP of 5 becomes - 5^3=125 \r\n\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\nisUgly = (num) => {\r\n\r\n\tif (num < 0) return false;\r\n\tif (num === 1) return true;\r\n\r\n\twhile (num % 2 === 0 ) { num /= 2}\r\n\twhile (num % 3 === 0 ) { num /= 3}\r\n\twhile (num % 5 === 0 ) { num /= 5}\r\n\t\r\n\treturn num === 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsole.log(isUgly(9000));"

Because, the Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range from 0 inclusive up to but not including 1. the formula can generate the correct amount of numbers but they always start at 0 because the range from Math.random starts from 0. https://teamtreehouse.com/community/need-an-explanation\r\n\r\nMath.random() returns a number from 0 to 1, not including one. Flooring this number will always result in a zero.\r\n\r\nIf you multiply this float by the max prior to flooring, you will get numbers all the way up to the maximum, including those below the minimum, but not the maximum itself. Say you have 10 as the maximum, you cannot get a 10.\r\n\r\nIn order to rule out those below the minimum, you subtract the minimum from the maximum. In order to include the maximum, you add one. This is all multiplied by the random floating point number between 0 and 1.\r\n\r\nAt that point, we aren't quite there. You will be receiving numbers based on the range between the minimum and maximum as explained above. Adding the minimum back in, post-randomizing, ensure that you have numbers that are between the minimum and the maximum.\r\n\r\nTLDR: The range of numbers (i.e. the number of numbers between min and max) is defined by those within the floor method's parentheses. The minimum added at the end ensures these numbers are between the desired minimum and maximum.\r\n\r\nBy subtracting the minimum number from the maximum, you define the range. Say you have minimum of 5 and a maximum of 20, you will get the range of 15. There are 15 possible numbers that you could select at random between these bounds.\r\n\r\nPaul-Note - So, if I dont add Min of 5, the formulae will give me all the random numbers between 0 and 15. But I want between 5 and 20. So thats why I add back the min.\r\n\r\nAnother great visual explanation at - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1527803/generating-random-whole-numbers-in-javascript-in-a-specific-range\r\n */\r\n\r\n// Beautiful single line - remove Duplicates from array with ES6 Sets and Spread\r\nlet removeDuplicatesFromArrAlt = arr => [...new Set(arr)];\r\n\r\nconsole.log(removeDuplicatesFromArrAlt([1,3,3,3,1,5,6,7,8,1]));"

            "content": "# Understanding how Promise makes code Asynchronous / non-blocking by understanding how Fetch API works\r\n\r\n## Key Point - With the .then() method, we can chain our ASYNCHRONOUS calls in a SYNCHRONOUS manner. So, within the Promise block, I am converting few Asynchronous operations to Synchronous ones.\r\n\r\n## And during that time when those Synchronous operations are getting executed, whatever is after the chain of methods inside the Promise-related block, gets executed normally without being blocked or having to wait for them, while I wait for some execution ( e.g. waiting for response from an API) to happen within the Promise’s block of codes.\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/@wisecobbler/using-the-javascript-fetch-api-f92c756340f0\r\n\r\nPromises allow you to write asynchronous code, so for example, when you are making a request to the server, you aren’t blocking other code from running while you are waiting for the response back from the server. This is important for the Fetch API since it’s main purpose is to make requests for assets or data. You don’t want to stop your entire application from running when making these requests.\r\n\r\nPromise objects have a .then() method which takes two parameters — a success callback function and failure callback function. In this example, when the fetch method successfully returns from making the API request, the success callback function is called which has a Response object as it’s parameter. The Response object also has several methods available to it, one of which is a .json() method which also returns Promise. So, if you want to do anything with a response from an API request and that response is in a JSON format, you’ll need to do this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfetch(\"http://api.exampledomain.com/api/search\")\r\n  .then(function(response) {\r\n    return response.json();\r\n  })\r\n  .then(function(jsonData) {\r\n    //handle json data processing here\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you’ve got multiple API requests you want to make and you want to handle the data in a specific order, or you don’t want to display anything on the screen until all the data is returned from the various API requests, you’ll be chaining quite a few .then() functions together.\r\n\r\nOf course in the above situation I will use Promise.all() - But I get the point from above, that how .then works - i.e. it makes 2 / 3 asynchronous execution to follow a particular order.\r\n\r\n## Use case of Promise.all()\r\n\r\nThere are few use cases where Async/Await doesn't cut it and we have to go back to Promises for help. One such scenario is when we need to make multiple independent asynchronous calls and wait for all of them to finish.\r\n\r\nIf we try and do this with async and await, the following will happen: \\*/\r\n\r\n```js\r\ngetABC = async () => {\r\n  let A = await getValueA(); // getValueA takes 2 second to finish\r\n  let B = await getValueB(); // getValueB takes 4 second to finish\r\n  let C = await getValueC(); // getValueC takes 3 second to finish\r\n\r\n  return A * B * C;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we know, the await expression causes async function execution to pause until a Promise is resolved, that is fulfilled or rejected, and to resume execution of the async function after fulfillment. When resumed, the value of the await expression is that of the fulfilled Promise.\r\n\r\nEach await call will wait for the previous one to return a result. Since we are doing one call at a time the entire function will take 9 seconds from start to finish (2+4+3).\r\n\r\nThis is not an optimal solution, since the three variables A, B, and C aren't dependent on each other. In other words we don't need to know the value of A before we get B. We can get them at the same time and shave off a few seconds of waiting.\r\n\r\nTo send all requests at the same time a Promise.all() is required. This will make sure we still have all the results before continuing, but the asynchronous calls will be firing in parallel, not one after another.\r\n\r\n```js\r\ngetABC = async () => {\r\n  // Promise.all() allows us to send all requests at the same time. But of course, it will give me 3 independent results, from the 3 independent function invocations. From those 3 independent results, getting the final return value by applying reduce on them.\r\n\r\n  let results = Promise.all([getValueA, getValueB, getValueC]);\r\n\r\n  return results.reduce((total, value) => total * value);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe getValueA and getValueC calls will have already finished by the time getValueB ends. Instead of a sum of the times, we will effectively reduce the execution to the time of the slowest request (getValueB - 4 seconds).\r\n"

Every .then() should either return a new Promise or just a value or object which will be passed to the next .then() in the chain.

That’s because any error that occurs in the Promise chain will stop further execution and an error will end up in the next .catch() in the chain.\r\n\r\nA friendly reminder: just like with callback based APIs, this is still asynchronous operations. The code that is executed when the request has finished — that is, the subsequent .then() calls — is put on the event loop just like a callback function would be. This means you cannot access any variables passed to or declared in the Promise chain outside the Promise. The same goes for errors thrown in the Promise chain.\r\n\r\n*/\r\n"

            "content": "#### A promise is an object that wraps an asynchronous operation and notifies when it’s done. This sounds exactly like callbacks, but the important differences are in the usage of Promises. Instead of providing a callback, a promise has its own methods (.then) which you call to tell the promise what will happen when it is successful or when it fails. The methods a promise provides are “then(…)” for when a successful result is available and “catch(…)” for when something went wrong.\r\n\r\n#### It takes 2 arguments and both are callback functions. The first one is for the fullfilment case and the socond one is for the rejection case.\r\n\r\n#### Promise in JS means, just as the word meaning, i.e. its not the value itself, but its the promise of a value.\r\n\r\n### Why Use Promises\r\n\r\nPromises provide a simpler alternative for executing, composing, and managing asynchronous operations when compared to traditional callback-based approaches. They also allow you to handle asynchronous errors using approaches that are similar to synchronous try/catch.\r\nPromise is basically just an object with 2 functions. A) A function named then() whcih is called anytime the promise is successful, and B) catch() function, which is called anytime something bad has happened.\r\n\r\n### All promise instances get a then method which allows you to react to the promise.  The first then method callback receives the result given to it by the resolve() call: The then method on the promise object adds handlers for the resolved and rejected states. This function returns another promise object to allow for promise-pipelining, enabling the developer to chain together async operations where the result of the first operation will get passed to the second.\r\n\r\n\r\nPromises have a then method, which you can use to get the eventual return value (fulfillment) or thrown exception (rejection).\r\n\r\n```js\r\npromiseMeSomething()\r\n    .then(function (value) {\r\n  }, function (reason) {\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n``then(resolvedHandler, rejectedHandler); ``\r\n\r\nIf promiseMeSomething returns a promise (remember that 'then' method returns a promise) that gets fulfilled later with a return value, the first function (the fulfillment handler) will be called with the value. However, if the promiseMeSomething function gets rejected later by a thrown exception, the second function (the rejection handler) will be called with the exception.\r\n\r\nNote that resolution of a promise is always asynchronous: that is, the fulfillment or rejection handler will always be called in the next turn of the event loop (i.e. process.nextTick in Node). This gives you a nice guarantee when mentally tracing the flow of your code, namely that then will always return before either handler is executed.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\r\n\t// A mock async action using setTimeout\r\n\tsetTimeout(() => resolve(10), 1000);\r\n})\r\n.then((result) => {\r\n\tconsole.log(result);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Outputs 10 after 1000 ms\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The then callback is triggered when the promise is resolved.  You can also chain then method callbacks:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\r\n\t// A mock async action using setTimeout\r\n\tsetTimeout(() => resolve(10), 1000);\r\n})\r\n.then(num => {\r\n    console.log(`first then: ${num} `);\r\n    return num * 2;\r\n})\r\n.then(num => {\r\n    console.log(`Second then: ${num} `)\r\n    return num * 2\r\n})\r\n.then(num => {\r\n    console.log(`Third then: ${num} `)\r\n    return num * 2\r\n})\r\n\r\n// output\r\nfirst then: 10\r\nSecond then: 20\r\nThird then: 40\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Each then receives the result of the previous then's return value. If a promise has already resolved but then is called again, the callback immediately fires. If the promise is rejected and you call then after rejection, the callback is never called.\r\n\r\nIf you return a value, the next \"then\" is called with that value. However, if you return something promise-like, the next \"then\" waits on it, and is only called when that promise settles (succeeds/fails)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfetchData().\r\n    then(prepareDataForCsv).\r\n    then(writeToCsv).\r\n    then(function () {\r\n    console.log('your csv has been saved');\r\n}).catch(function (error) {\r\n    console.log('something went wrong', error);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Because of how the chaining of promises and errors work, as discussed earlier, it means that just one catch at the end of the chain is guaranteed to catch any errors thrown along the way. This makes error handling really straight forward.\r\n\r\n# Some of the key points of Promise’s Engineering\r\n\r\nA> http://farzicoder.com/Callback-Hell-Promises-generators-Async-Await-in-Node-js-Javascript/\r\n\r\n## A promise is an object that is returned immediately but the result arrives later in future. Promise takes a method with two arguments, resolve and reject. resolve is called when we have a result and reject is called when we have an error. This promise object returned has two methods, then and catch. then gets the result which was raised through the resolve method. catch gets the error thrown with the reject method. Using promises we can chain our asynchronous call in a synchronous manner.\r\n\r\n## B> BEST EXPLANATION - A promise is an object which can be returned synchronously from an asynchronous function. : - By Eric Elliot\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-promise-27fc71e77261\r\n\r\nBecause ``.then()`` always returns a new promise, it’s possible to chain promises with precise control over how and where errors are handled. Promises allow you to mimic normal synchronous code’s try/catch behavior.\r\n\r\nLike synchronous code, chaining will result in a sequence that runs in serial. In other words, you can do:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfetch(url)\r\n  .then(process)\r\n  .then(save)\r\n  .catch(handleErrors);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming each of the functions, fetch(), process(), and save() return promises, process() will wait for fetch() to complete before starting, and save() will wait for process() to complete before starting. handleErrors() will only run if any of the previous promises reject."

            "content": "# How .then() actually makes few asynchronous calls happen in particular order one after another\r\n\r\nA> https://spring.io/understanding/javascript-promises\r\n\r\nA function passed to then can also return another promise. This allows asynchronous operations to be chained together, so that they are guaranteed to happen in the correct order.\r\n\r\nB> https://medium.com/codebuddies/getting-to-know-asynchronous-javascript-callbacks-promises-and-async-await-17e0673281ee\r\n\r\nThe true power of promises is shown when you have several asynchronous operations that depend on each other. So let’s take the case where we have to make a request that depends on the result of another request.\r\n\r\n## Callback Hell Example\r\nCallbacks are a good way to declare what will happen once an I/O operation has a result, but what if you want to use that data in order to make another request? You can only handle the result of the request (if we use the example above) within the callback function provided.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar request = require('request');\r\n\r\nlet result;\r\n\r\nrequest('http://www.google.com', (error, response, body) => {\r\n    if (error) {\r\n        // Handle error\r\n    } else {\r\n        result = body;\r\n        console.log(\"Request successful\")\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n\r\nconsole.log(result);\r\n\r\n/* OUTPUT\r\n\r\nundefined\r\nRequest successful\r\n*/\r\n```\r\nIn this example above, the variable “result” will not have a value when printed to the console at the last line. And will output “undefined” to the console because at the time that line is being executed, the callback has not been called. Even if the request were somehow to complete before the result variable is printed to the console (which is almost impossible as though, as inside the callback I am making a network request to google.com server), this code will still run to completion before the callback is executed anyway because that is the nature of the non-blocking I/O model in JavaScript.\r\n\r\n## Because, by the non-blocking architecture, of JS / Node, while the callback is being executed ( making a request to google.com in this case) - the rest of the code after the callback function's block will continue to get executed.\r\n\r\n``( See my explanation in - Asynchronous-Non-blocking-Mechanism-in-Node.md)``\r\n\r\nSo if we want to do a second request based on the result of a first one we have to do it inside the callback function of the first request because that is where the result will be available:\r\n```js\r\nvar request = require('request');\r\n\r\nlet result;\r\n\r\nrequest('http://www.google.com', function (firstError, firstResponse, firstBody) {\r\n    if(firstError){\r\n        // Handle error.\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        request(`https://www.facebook.com`, function (secondError, secondResponse, secondBody) {\r\n            if(secondError){\r\n                // Handle error.\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                result = secondBody;\r\n                console.log('successfully hit facebook server')\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\nconsole.log(result);\r\n\r\n/* OUTPUT\r\n\r\nundefined\r\nsuccessfully hit facebook server\r\n*/\r\n\r\n```\r\nOne thing to note here is the first argument in every callback function will contain an error if something went wrong, or will be empty if all went well. This pattern is called “error first callbacks” and is very common. It is the standard pattern for callback-based APIs in NodeJs. This means that for every callback declared we need to check if there is an error and that just adds to the mess when dealing with nested callbacks.\r\n\r\nThis is the anti-pattern that has been named “callback hell”.\r\n\r\n\r\n### A promise is an object that wraps an asynchronous operation and notifies when it’s done. This sounds exactly like callbacks, but the important differences are in the usage of Promises. Instead of providing a callback, a promise has its own methods (.then) which you call to tell the promise what will happen when it is successful or when it fails. The methods a promise provides are “then(…)” for when a successful result is available and “catch(…)” for when something went wrong.\r\n\r\nBelow is general syntax\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsomeAsyncOperation(someParams)\r\n.then(function(result){\r\n    // Do something with the result\r\n})\r\n.catch(function(error){\r\n    // Handle error\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, handle the above case with Promise I am using “axios” that is similar to “request” package but it uses promises instead of callbacks.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst axios = require(‘axios’);\r\n\r\naxios.get(‘http://www.somepage.com')\r\n.then(function (response) {\r\n    // response being the result of the first request\r\n    // Returns another promise to the next .then(..) in the chain\r\n    return axios.get(`http://www.somepage.com/${response.someValue}`);\r\n})\r\n.then(function response {\r\n    // response being the result of the second request\r\n    // Handle response\r\n})\r\n.catch(function (error) {\r\n    // Handle error.\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of nesting callbacks inside callbacks inside callbacks, you chain .then() calls together making it more readable and easier to follow. Every .then() should either return a new Promise or just a value or object which will be passed to the next .then() in the chain. Another important thing to notice is that even though we are doing two different asynchronous requests we only have one .catch() where we handle our errors. That’s because any error that occurs in the Promise chain will stop further execution and an error will end up in the next .catch() in the chain.\r\n\r\nA friendly reminder: just like with callback based APIs, this is still asynchronous operations. The code that is executed when the request has finished — that is, the subsequent .then() calls — is put on the event loop just like a callback function would be. This means you cannot access any variables passed to or declared in the Promise chain outside the Promise. The same goes for errors thrown in the Promise chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n### As a side note, remember the general syntax of chaining together axios calls\r\n\r\n```JS\r\naxios.get('http://google.com')\r\n    .then((response) => {\r\n        // do something with Google res\r\n        return axios.get('http://apple.com')\r\n        // response being the result of the first request\r\n        // do something with Apple res\r\n    })\r\n    .catch((err) => {\r\n        // handle err\r\n    })\r\n"

We're evaluating your ability to take a set of requirements and spike a holistic solution that demonstrates craftsmanship, thoughtfulness and good architectural design. This is **NOT** a test of how well you know Python/Django/Flask/SQL, nor should you try to impress us with overly clever and obtuse solutions. If you want to impress us, build something that is beautiful, intuitive and easy to debug/test/extend :smiley: .\r\n\r\nIdeally your solution would have some way to run locally and test the results so we can fully analyze your efforts.\r\n\r\n## Choose **One** Of the following\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> :rotating_light: :exclamation: :point_right: **Please use one of the salary datasets provided here for either exercise [/shared/salary_datasets](/shared/salary_datasets)** :point_left: :exclamation: :rotating_light:\r\n\r\n### Exercise A: Expose an API for querying compensation data\r\n\r\nThe goal of this exercise is to design a read-only API (REST or GraphAPI) that returns one or more records from static set of compensation data.\r\n\r\n#### User Story: As a developer I want to\r\n\r\n- list compensation data via API `GET` request\r\n  - Filter by one or more fields/attributes (e.g. `/compensation_data?salary[gte]=120000&zip_code=11201` )\r\n  - Sort by one or more fields/attributes (e.g. `/compensation_data?sort=last_name`)\r\n- fetch a single record via GET request\r\n  - **Stretch Goal**: return a sparse fieldset (e.g. `/compensation_data?fields=first_name,last_name,salary`)\r\n- have the JSON response be normalized into a uniform schema via a serializer or json template\r\n  - **Stretch Goal**: serialize more than one compensation [data set](/shared/salary_datasets)\r\n\r\n### A few quick notes on submitting Exercise A\r\n\r\n- Don't worry about any web application concerns other than serializing JSON and returning via a GET request.\r\n- The example above (`/compensation_data`...) is not a contract. Feel free to design the URL structure and JSON schema that you believe creates the best client/consumer experience\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Exercise B: Database Design Exercise - Storing Compensation Data\r\n\r\nThe goal of this exercise is to design a highly normalized database schema for storing compensation data\r\n\r\n- Create a schema for storing the compensation data provided in one of the [available data sets](/shared/salary_datasets). This schema should be in at least [3NF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form) with tables for **employee**, **role**, and anything else that makes sense for the data given.\r\n- Upload at least one dataset to the schema\r\n  - **Stretch Goal**: upload all 3 salary datasets to the database schema\r\n- Validate that you can perform the following queries. You can export the results of these queries via CSV or attach screenshots of the the output\r\n  - Average compensation of roles where the role is some kind of engineer (hint: `ILIKE`)\r\n  - Average, min, and max compensation per city (if available in dataset)\r\n  - One interesting query of your choice (_average compensation by gender perhaps???_)\r\n- Create a quick database schema diagram\r\n  - Many admin tools and clients will allow you to generate these from your schema. If not possible, just draw a super-simple diagram in MS Paint or similar tool 🎨\r\n\r\n### A few quick notes on submitting Exercise B\r\n\r\n- Ideally this exercise would use SQLite or Postgres, but any SQL database is OK\r\n- Feel free to upload the entire SQL dump (with schema) of the populated database, or create a script that creates the schema and populates the database with one or more of the provided salary data CSVs. Please do whatever makes the most sense given the time alloted.\r\n- If you'd like to use a scripting language like Python or Ruby along with an ORM to make this easier, thats fine with us!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Submitting your exercise\r\n\r\nCreate a new private repository for your exercise and add the our hiring team members as private collaborators (We do this to preserve your anonymity so it's not obvious you are looking for a new tole.)\r\n\r\nJohnDoe@gmail.com (Head of Engineering)\r\n\r\nComplete as much of the exercise as you can in 3 hours or less. Unless otherwise specified in the instructions.md document, you can use any language, framework, or toolchain you wish, although ideally this would be Python, Javascript (ReactJS), and SQL (purely because those are the languages we use to build Welcome and will be the most familiar with)\r\n\r\nBe sure to include the following in your submission\r\n\r\n- a README.md with the following information\r\n- A few screenshots of the finished product. Show off that work! camera_flash\r\n- The exercise you choose and why\r\n- A short explanation of what you built\r\n- How to test/demo/run (if applicable)\r\n- NOTE: a 'working' exercise is awesome, however it is NOT a hard requirement. We mean it!\r\n- Any feedback/notes (i.e. if something was hard, confusing, frustrating, etc)\r\n- Anything else you'd lke us to know about your submission\r\n- a ROADMAP.md with what you would add/change if you had more time. Dream big.\r\n- a super-simple test suite if applicable (even one test is a bonus)\r\n- Some form of lightweight technical documentation (code comments are fine)\r\n- When complete email a link to the repository and any special instructions to JohnDoe@gmail.com\r\n\r\nSit back and relax. We'll review your submission and get back to you within 48 hours smiley\r\n"

We understand we may not be\r\nthe only company asking for an exercise from you and want to be respectful of\r\nyour time. The test is designed for all levels, and you could spend much longer\r\nperfecting your solution if you wanted to. We recommend you focus on the core\r\nrequirements first, then work on any additional features if you have the time.\r\n\r\nBy 4 hours in, please feel free to stop working and explain what refactors /\r\ncode organization / enhancements you would have made with more time in the\r\nSOLUTION.md file (You have to create this SOLUTION.md file).\r\n\r\n## Submission\r\n\r\nPlease commit all your changes to this git repository. When you're done:\r\n\r\n1. Create a zip / tarball of this repository (excluding `node_modules`) and\r\n   submit it to https://www.dropbox.com/request/06JH3TUA6dBnNuzEe3FS\r\n2. Email Anna to let her know you're done.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nWe’ve built a simple Autocomplete/Typeahead component in vanilla ES2015 that\r\nlets you type in a query and shows a list of matching results in a dropdown,\r\njust like how Google's search box works.\r\n\r\nTo see this component in action, let's set up the repo:\r\n\r\n1. Run `npm install`\r\n2. Run `npm start` (runs `webpack-dev-server`)\r\n3. Open `http://localhost:8080` on your browser.\r\n\r\nType \"new\" in the input, and you'll get a list of matching US states that start\r\nwith \"new\".\r\n\r\n## Task\r\n\r\nCurrently, the component can only query against a static data array and only\r\nworks with mouse clicks. Your task is to:\r\n\r\n1. Enhance the component so that it also accepts an HTTP endpoint as data source.\r\n\r\n   For example, if you wire up the component to\r\n   `https://api.github.com/search/users?q={query}&per_page=${numOfResults}`,\r\n   and if you type `foo` in the input, the component dropdown should show\r\n   Github users with logins that start with `foo`. When you select a user from\r\n   the results, `item` in the `onSelect(item)` callback should be the selected\r\n   Github user's id.\r\n\r\n   (The enhanced component only needs to work with either a data array or a\r\n   HTTP source, not both.)\r\n\r\n2. Implement keyboard shortcuts to navigate the results dropdown using up/down\r\n   arrow keys and to select a result using the Enter key.\r\n\r\nUncomment the relevant sections in `index.js` and `index.html` to implement a\r\ndemo that looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Demo example screenshot](assets/demo-example.png)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- The component should be reusable. It should be possible to have multiple\r\n  instances of the component on the same page.\r\n- The \"States\" example that uses a data array should continue to work.\r\n- The component should accept any HTTP endpoint, not just the\r\n  `https://api.github.com/users` example above.\r\n- Your component should work correctly in Chrome, don’t worry about\r\n  cross-browser compatibility.\r\n- You can use small DOM helpers like jQuery or utilities from Lodash, but not\r\n  larger libraries/frameworks like React, Angular or Vue.js\r\n- You don't need to preserve any of the existing code; feel free to modify them\r\n  as you wish.\r\n- New APIs should be documented in `SOLUTION.md`.\r\n"

The user should be able to expand a GIF and see its details (username, rating, anything you think could be relevant).\r\n\r\nUsers should have a good user experience on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.\r\n\r\nThis project is pretty open ended in order to leave you some freedom to improve upon the base by focusing on what you like the most.\r\n\r\nWe strongly encourage you to pick a couple of optional improvements. The following are just some ideas, so if none of these interest you, feel free to do something that isn’t on this list:\r\n\r\n- When the user scrolls the page to the bottom, load new GIFs automatically.\r\n- Create a mosaic layout and display a placeholder when GIFs are still loading.\r\n- Show off your animation skills!\r\n- Sort the results by uploaded time and let the user choose if they prefer ascending or descending ordering.\r\n- Let the user favorite GIFs and list their favorites. The users should be able to retrieve their favorite GIFs even after refreshing the page.\r\n- Provide the ultimate user experience: scrolling, searching, fetching… could be optimized for UX.\r\n- Let the user upload a GIF.\r\n- Add some unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Project Structure\r\n\r\nWe've included all of the boilerplate to get started with this project using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), feel free to use this structure if you'd like. If you'd prefer to use something other than React or you'd prefer a different project structure, go ahead and make any changes you'd like.\r\n\r\n### Evaluation\r\n\r\nThe app should run on any computer by running `npm install` and `npm start`.\r\nWe’ll evaluate the exercise by looking at the end result and the code.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nPlease, don't open a PR against this repo. Just follow the direction from the recruiter on how to submit the exercise.\r\n\r\n### Coding at our Team\r\n\r\nWe strive for writing simple, maintainable and clean code.\r\n\r\nWe prefer simplicity over complexity.\r\n\r\nWe comment our code and commit often.\r\n\r\nWe love our users and we really care about providing a good user experience and pleasant UI.\r\n\r\nWe encourage out of the box thinking and we love to be impressed!\r\n"

This is **NOT** a test of how well you know React or ES7+, nor should you try to impress us with overly clever and obtuse solutions. If you want to impress us, build something that is beautiful, intuitive and easy to debug/test/extend :smiley: .\r\n\r\nIdeally your solution would have some way to run locally and visualize the results in a browser so we can fully analyze the experience and not just the source code.\r\n\r\n# Choose One Of the following\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Exercise A: Creating an offer\r\n\r\n### As a hiring manager I want to\r\n\r\n- Create a a new offer of employement\r\n  - Specify the monetary compensation details of an offer (salary, equity, bonus, etc)\r\n  - Specify non-monetary compensation and benefits (culture, learning opportunities, etc)\r\n- See a list of the offers I've created\r\n- Share a link to an offer via a unique URL\r\n\r\n### As an employee receiving an offer I want to\r\n\r\n- View an offer that was sent to me\r\n  - **stretch goal**: Ask a question about the offer (ideally a subsection of the offer)\r\n- Understand the non-salary compensation I am being offered (stock valuation, value of healthcare benefits)\r\n- See detail about the role, team, and organization\r\n\r\n## Exercise B: Visualizing Compensation and Benefits\r\n\r\n### As a HR-team member I want to\r\n\r\n- \"Upload\" a CSV/JSON file with my the compensation data of my current organization\r\n  - **NOTE**: You don't need to create an API around file storage/IO. Use any/all of the sample files in [/shared/salary_datasets](/shared/salary_datasets) or create your own simple faked data set.\r\n- View the data in a simple tabular view\r\n  - **stretch goal**: be able to sort or search by any unique identifiers (name, email, etc) so I can find specific rows\r\n- View simple visualization(s) of the distribution of salary compensation so I can get an overview/aggregate of overall compensation\r\n  - **stretch goal**: be able to visualize data across more than one dimension\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Submitting your exercise\r\n\r\nCreate a new private repository for your exercise and add the our hiring team members as private collaborators (We do this to preserve your anonymity so it's not obvious you are looking for a new tole.)\r\n\r\nJohnDoe@gmail.com (Head of Engineering)\r\n\r\nComplete as much of the exercise as you can in 3 hours or less. Unless otherwise specified in the instructions.md document, you can use any language, framework, or toolchain you wish, although ideally this would be Python, Javascript (ReactJS), and SQL (purely because those are the languages we use to build Welcome and will be the most familiar with)\r\n\r\nBe sure to include the following in your submission\r\n\r\n- a README.md with the following information\r\n- A few screenshots of the finished product. Show off that work! camera_flash\r\n- The exercise you choose and why\r\n- A short explanation of what you built\r\n- How to test/demo/run (if applicable)\r\n- NOTE: a 'working' exercise is awesome, however it is NOT a hard requirement. We mean it!\r\n- Any feedback/notes (i.e. if something was hard, confusing, frustrating, etc)\r\n- Anything else you'd lke us to know about your submission\r\n- a ROADMAP.md with what you would add/change if you had more time. Dream big.\r\n- a super-simple test suite if applicable (even one test is a bonus)\r\n- Some form of lightweight technical documentation (code comments are fine)\r\n- When complete email a link to the repository and any special instructions to JohnDoe@gmail.com\r\n\r\nSit back and relax. We'll review your submission and get back to you within 48 hours smiley\r\n"

        "content": "# ExampleCompany take home test\r\n\r\nThis is a frontend exercise that will give you a chance to see some of the things we build at ExampleCompany.\r\n\r\nAt ExampleCompany we want to make instructing AI systems as intuitive as teaching a colleague. Right now, machine learning instruction happens primarily through providing hundreds of hand labelled examples, so we want to make that process as easy, intuitive and _fun_ as possible.\r\n\r\nFor this task, we look at the problem of [named-entity recognition (NER)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition). We would like you to build an annotation interface for NER – to display a textual document and be able to label spans of text with one of a handful of classes.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n- the user needs to be able to read the document\r\n- select a span of text\r\n- assign one of the predefined labels `['person', 'organization', 'location', 'misc']` to the text.\r\n- the user can see the state of the highlighted text\r\n- the user can remove an annoation\r\n- the annotations should be available as a JSON array of objects with the following structure of start and end indexes, the inside text, and the label\r\n\r\n```\r\n[{\"start\": 12, \"end\": 30, \"text\": \"Southampton United\", label: 'organization'},]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow you do this is up to you! People can spend a long time annotating documents like this, so some thought to making intuitive, robust and maybe even fun is wanted.\r\n\r\n# Guidelines\r\n\r\nWe'd like you to spend no more than 3-4 hours working on this. Please let us know how much time you spent so we can calibrate our expectations.\r\n\r\n# Hints / Tips\r\n\r\n- This initial code is using React. If you'd prefer to use other libraries or frameworks, you're welcome to.\r\n- You can use any libraries, frameworks, tools you want.\r\n- Pick any UI toolkit or component library (Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, Ant Design etc.) you'd like to use, but try to make everything look consistent.\r\n- How you want to store state is up to you.\r\n- It doesn't have to look pixel perfect and it doesn't need amazing animations, but we do care a lot about UX and usability at ExampleCompany.\r\n- Paying attention to details like padding, alignment, and cursors is appreciated!\r\n- Handle the UX edge-cases! For example, what happens when the spans overflow a single line?\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n\r\nThis project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\r\nRun the following commands to get started.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd app\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can clear out the file structure as you wish.\r\n\r\nAny questions, let us know! team@humanloop.com\r\n"

We understand we may not be\r\nthe only company asking for an exercise from you and want to be respectful of\r\nyour time. The test is designed for all levels, and you could spend much longer\r\nperfecting your solution if you wanted to. We recommend you focus on the core\r\nrequirements first, then work on any additional features if you have the time.\r\n\r\nBy 4 hours in, please feel free to stop working and explain what refactors /\r\ncode organization / enhancements you would have made with more time in the\r\nSOLUTION.md file (You have to create this SOLUTION.md file).\r\n\r\n## Submission\r\n\r\nPlease commit all your changes to this git repository. When you're done:\r\n\r\n1. Create a zip / tarball of this repository (excluding `node_modules`) and\r\n   submit it to https://www.dropbox.com/request/06JH3TUA6dBnNuzEe3FS\r\n2. Email Anna to let her know you're done.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nWe’ve built a simple Autocomplete/Typeahead component in vanilla ES2015 that\r\nlets you type in a query and shows a list of matching results in a dropdown,\r\njust like how Google's search box works.\r\n\r\nTo see this component in action, let's set up the repo:\r\n\r\n1. Run `npm install`\r\n2. Run `npm start` (runs `webpack-dev-server`)\r\n3. Open `http://localhost:8080` on your browser.\r\n\r\nType \"new\" in the input, and you'll get a list of matching US states that start\r\nwith \"new\".\r\n\r\n## Task\r\n\r\nCurrently, the component can only query against a static data array and only\r\nworks with mouse clicks. Your task is to:\r\n\r\n1. Enhance the component so that it also accepts an HTTP endpoint as data source.\r\n\r\n   For example, if you wire up the component to\r\n   `https://api.github.com/search/users?q={query}&per_page=${numOfResults}`,\r\n   and if you type `foo` in the input, the component dropdown should show\r\n   Github users with logins that start with `foo`. When you select a user from\r\n   the results, `item` in the `onSelect(item)` callback should be the selected\r\n   Github user's id.\r\n\r\n   (The enhanced component only needs to work with either a data array or a\r\n   HTTP source, not both.)\r\n\r\n2. Implement keyboard shortcuts to navigate the results dropdown using up/down\r\n   arrow keys and to select a result using the Enter key.\r\n\r\nUncomment the relevant sections in `index.js` and `index.html` to implement a\r\ndemo that looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Demo example screenshot](demo-example.png)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- The component should be reusable. It should be possible to have multiple\r\n  instances of the component on the same page.\r\n- The \"States\" example that uses a data array should continue to work.\r\n- The component should accept any HTTP endpoint, not just the\r\n  `https://api.github.com/users` example above.\r\n- Your component should work correctly in Chrome, don’t worry about\r\n  cross-browser compatibility.\r\n- You can use small DOM helpers like jQuery or utilities from Lodash, but not\r\n  larger libraries/frameworks like React, Angular or Vue.js\r\n- You don't need to preserve any of the existing code; feel free to modify them\r\n  as you wish.\r\n- New APIs should be documented in `SOLUTION.md`.\r\n"

I answered by explaining her the complete architecture on the white board.\r\nThen she asked how much would I rate myself in DS & Algo on a scale of 1-10.\r\nThen she asked the following questions:\r\n1) Reverse a linked list.\r\n2) Cloning a linked list having next and random pointer.\r\n3)Mirror of a Binary tree.\r\n\r\n## Questions on Java:\r\n\r\n1)Difference between static synchronized block and non static Synchronized block.\r\n2)Why wait() , notify() and notifyAll() methods are in Object class.\r\n3)Why string is Immutable? Is it possible to have a synchronized block that locks on to a String object?\r\n\r\n### Question on MongoDB:\r\n\r\n1)How to achieve Horizontal scaling in MongoDB.What all servers are required to do the same.\r\n\r\n2)There’s a student collection which has multiple documents for different subjects.How to aggregate all records of all students and have a single array field having all marks of a given student.\r\n\r\nRound 2 (Technical F2F):\r\nThis round was the toughest, not because the questions were tough but it lasted forever(more than 3 hours)\r\n\r\n### 1) Problem statement:\r\n\r\nThere’s a file that contains URL and description of some websites delimited by comma.I need to read that file and write it back to another file in a sorted manner. The input file may have different description for same website.Ex: www.google.com/blogs/career , www.google.com/ home/etc will have different descriptions.\r\nThe output file should have only one entry for a particular website but can have many descriptions.\r\nI gave him a solution which he felt was good.\r\nHe then altered the problem statement . Now, instead of 1 file there is a directory of files and all needs to be read and written back in a new file in sorted manner.He hinted that he’s looking for a multi threaded solution .\r\nI gave a solution using Thread pool executor and after a long discussion he was happy with the solution.\r\n\r\n2) What is Hash code? Difference between HashMap and HashTable ? How HashMap is implemented internally? How linear probing leads to clustering? Can we have null key in a HashMap?\r\n\r\n3) He asked me to explain Observer pattern (because I had told him that I used it in one of the projects ) . He asked me to move over to the white board and explain with proper class diagrams.\r\nWhy composition is preferred over inheritance was one of the many questions that he asked while I was explaining implementation of observer pattern.\r\n\r\n4)What are deadlocks ? When do they occur? How to avoid them? How to avoid them in Java?Write a code that leads to a deadlock.\r\n\r\n5)There’s a website that shows online content when there’s internet connection and offline content like downloads when offline.There’s a switch that tells if the website is online or offline.There’s a display() method that displays the appropriate content.How to implement that display method?He was not really looking for any code but the approach . I told him that we’ll have a Screen interface that has a display() method and there would be two concrete implementations : online screen and offline screen of the screen interface where I’ll override the display() method. He was content with solution.\r\n\r\n6) Implement a BST which supports insertion , deletion and search.\r\n\r\n7) Rotate an array by K times.\r\n\r\n8) Given an array find the maximum value of Σarr[i]*i, where i = 0, 1, 2,…., n – 1.( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximize-sum-arrii/)\r\n\r\n9) Why to prefer Synchronized block over Synchronized method?\r\n\r\n10) Explain Quick sort .\r\n\r\n### Round 3 (Technical F2F):\r\n\r\n1) When should we go for in memory caching? (because my resume says that I’ve worked on MemcacheD)\r\n2) Explain micro services architecture.(I explained him with an overview of how docker containers work and how we can have container orchestration using Kuberenetes)\r\n3) How Agile way of development is different from the traditional waterfall model?\r\n4) How PAAS is different from IAAS.(Cloud computing)\r\n5) Implement a queue using stack.\r\n\r\n### Round 4(Managerial + Technical F2F)\r\n\r\n1)How to kick start a springboot application?\r\n2)What are the different scope of Spring beans?\r\n3) Difference between PUT and PATCH requests in REST api.\r\n4)Why do you want to join SAP labs?\r\n\r\nRound 5 (Technical -Telephonic):\r\nThis was a cross LOB round where a person from a different team interviewed.\r\n1)How to achieve Many2Many mappings in Hibernate.\r\n2)Use of @Qulifier annotation in Spring?\r\n3) How dispatcher servlet works?\r\n4)How a class in loaded into JVM?\r\n\r\nRound 6( HR)\r\nThe basic HR questions :\r\nWhere do you see yourself in 5 years?\r\nWhy do you want to quit your cureent job?\r\nSalary negotiation .(Which I regret not doing.)\r\n\r\nFinally got the offer !!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It can be less than twelve, but beware if more than 12, as your offending divs will bump down to the next row (not .row, which is another story altogether).\r\n\r\nSimilarly for the following line -\r\n\r\n`<div class=\"col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\">`\r\n\r\nFrom the online version of the book-section 7.3 – The line creates a single column for medium screen, of width 6 (i.e. half of the total 12 given by bootstrap)\r\n\r\nSee - http://getbootstrap.com/examples/grid/ for the full list of col sizes\r\n\r\n#### Explanation of <div class=“row”>\r\n\r\n#### <div class=\"row\"> You only need them if you're using the grid system of Bootstrap\r\n\r\nA) http://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-bootstrap-grid-system/ - “A row acts like a wrapper around the columns. The row nullifies the padding set by the container element by using a negative margin value of -15px on both the left and right sides. A row spans from the left edge to the right edge of the container element. It is created by adding the class “.row” to a block level element inside the container.”\r\n\r\nEach set of nested divs also span up to 12 columns of their parent div. NOTE: Since each .col class has 15px padding on either side, you should usually wrap nested columns in a .row, which has -15px margins. This avoids duplicating the padding and keeps the content lined up between nested and non-nested col classes.\r\n\r\nB) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19138430/bootstrap-rows - very good explanation\r\n\r\n**<div class=\"row\">** - are just what they sound like, they are rows. You use them when you want to separate information horizontally in bootstrap's grid layout\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-the-bootstrap-3-grid-system](https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-the-bootstrap-3-grid-system)\r\n"

We can think of the & as a mechanism that allows us to place the parent selector wherever we need it in our child selector.\r\n\r\n#### Using the & with pseudo classes\r\n\r\nYou can write pseudo classes on a class in a much less repetitive way with the &:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n    .button {\r\n  &:visited { }\r\n  &:hover { }\r\n  &:active { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis compiles to:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.button:visited {\r\n}\r\n.button:hover {\r\n}\r\n.button:active {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe & in this case allows us to position .button directly next to pseudo classes without repetition in the authored code. If we left out the & from this example, basic nesting would put a space between them like this…\r\n\r\n`.button :hover`\r\n\r\nwhich isn’t the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd thats why at the root of the .scss file I can not have an ampersand &\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n&.sdk-ng-select .ng-dropdown-panel {\r\n  @include sdk-ng-select();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt will give me following error \r\n\r\n```\r\nSassError: Base-level rules cannot contain the parent-selector-referencing character\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Relevant issue in Saas github repo](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/1873#issuecomment-152293725)\r\n\r\n\"This error has existed since 3.0 which was released in May 2010.\r\n\r\nIt's nonsensical to refer to a parent selector at the base-level of a stylesheet.

For example, what if we need a different border treatment for our `.hoverable`element when the parent class is `.special`\r\n\r\nThe SASS without a nested \"&\" would be below\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.hoverable {\r\n  color: #fff;\r\n  &:hover {\r\n    color: #ff0;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.special .hoverable {\r\n  border: 1px solid #f00;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing this required us to step out of our .hoverable selector and then re-define it inside a new selector. If there had been more levels of nesting, or more context that needed to be set, that could have been a fairly complex action.\r\n\r\nBut with the ampersand, Sass allows us to do the same thing without leaving the scope of the .hoverable selector:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.hoverable {\r\n  color: #fff;\r\n  &:hover {\r\n    color: #ff0;\r\n  }\r\n  .special & {\r\n    border: 1px solid #f00;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of these Sass snippets will result in the following CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.hoverable {\r\n  color: #fff;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.hoverable:hover {\r\n  color: #ff0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.special .hoverable {\r\n  border: 1px solid #f00;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Sass replaced the ampersand with the parent selector, defining a new selector inside of the `.special` selector. And note because here, there a single space before the \"&\" - so the generated css will also have a single space before the parent selector (i.e. before .hoverable )"

A child combinator is made of the \"greater-than sign\" (U+003E, >) code point and separates two compound selectors.\r\n\r\nExamples: The following selector represents a p element that is child of body:\r\nbody > p\r\nThe following example combines descendant combinators and child combinators.\r\n\r\n`div ol>li p`\r\n\r\nIt represents a p element that is a descendant of an li element; the li element must be the child of an ol element; the ol element must be a descendant of a div. Notice that the optional white space around the \">\" combinator has been left out.\r\n\r\nSo in the above **descendant** means an elmenent can be a child or grandchild or any level of nested child.\r\n\r\n#### The main point is **>** is the **child combinator**, which means it must be the direct child of a parent element. \r\n#### Whereas a descendant combinator is whitespace that separates two compound selectors.\r\n\r\n### A good example from production grade real-life app - to declare the styles of a parent class with ALL its direct children to have this styles. A blanket declaration to capture all direct childrent with the \"*\"\r\n\r\nparent.component.scss\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.parent-wrapping-class {\r\n  > * {\r\n    margin-right: 1rem\r\n    margin-bottom: 1.2rem\r\n    height: 3.571rem\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  > *:last-child {\r\n    margin-right: 0;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the html will be like below, (this is an Angular .html file)\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"parent-wrapping-class\">\r\n    <child-component\r\n      [item]=\"data\"\r\n      [disabled]=\"disabled\"      \r\n    >\r\n    </child-component>\r\n\r\n    <another-child-component\r\n      [item]=\"data\"\r\n      [disabled]=\"disabled\"      \r\n    >\r\n    </another-child-component>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in the above case all the direct children of \"parent-wrapping-class\" ( e.g. `child-component` and `another-child-component` )will get the styles as delacred in the .scss file\r\n\r\n#### Descendant combinator\r\n\r\nAt times, authors may want selectors to describe an element that is the descendant of another element in the document tree (e.g., \"an em element that is contained within an H1 element\"). The descendant combinator expresses such a relationship.\r\n\r\n**Examples of Descendant combinator** : For example, consider the following selector:\r\n\r\nh1 em\r\nIt represents an em element being the descendant of an h1 element.\r\n\r\nBut **>** means it must be the direct child of a parent element.\r\n\r\nThats why **>** is the **child combinator**, sometimes mistakenly called the **direct descendant combinator**\r\n\r\nThat means the selector div > p.some_class only selects paragraphs of .some_class that are nested directly inside a div, and not any paragraphs that are nested further within.\r\n\r\nAn illustration:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p class=\"some_class\">Some text here</p>\r\n\t<!-- Selected [1] -->\r\n\t<blockquote>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"some_class\">More text here</p>\r\n\t\t<!-- Not selected [2] -->\r\n\t</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanations of what's selected and what's not:\r\n\r\n**Selected**\r\n\r\nThis p.some_class is located directly inside the div, hence a parent-child relationship is established between both elements.\r\n\r\n**Not selected**\r\n\r\nThis p.some_class is contained by a blockquote within the div, rather than the div itself. Although this p.some_class is a descendant of the div, it's not a child; it's a grandchild.\r\n\r\nConsequently, while **div > p.some_class** won't match this element, **div p.some_class** will, using the **descendant combinator** instead.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[descendant-combinators](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#descendant-combinators)\r\n\r\n[child-combinators](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#child-combinators)\r\n"

From there, all pagination related rulesets are contained within this declaration block by using nesting and the ampersand. Among the other benefits of nesting that I've alluded to earlier, this means that when another developer has to work on a component, they only need to look in one place!\r\n\r\nPutting together what we've looked at so far, that pagination file could look something like this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.pagination {\r\n  &-number {\r\n    // & = .pagination-number\r\n    &.is-current {\r\n      border: 3px solid green;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  // & = .pagination\r\n  &-prev {\r\n    background-color: red;\r\n    // & = .pagination-prev\r\n    &:after {\r\n      content: '<';\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// which compiles to \r\n\r\n.pagination-number.is-current {\r\n  border: 3px solid green;\r\n}\r\n.pagination-prev {\r\n  background-color: red;\r\n}\r\n.pagination-prev:after {\r\n  content: '<';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Source](https://bit.ly/37qH1qI)"

Use them to change appearance or behavior.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\ndisabled, highlighted, checked, fixed, size big, color yellow\r\n\r\nCSS class is formed as block’s or element’s name plus two dashes: .block--mod or .block\\_\\_elem--mod and .block--color-black with .block--color-red\r\n\r\n#### Now an example\r\n\r\nLet’s say we want to build a card component. The block would be .card. Then any sections within card would be elements. So in this example, we have image, description, button. BEM naming convention connects block and element with two underscores ex. card\\_\\_image.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have two different types of buttons, success and back. We call these modifiers and we connect them with our element with two dashes, for example .card--button--success.\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/@dannyhuang_75970/what-is-bem-and-why-you-should-use-it-in-your-project-ab37c6d10b79](https://medium.com/@dannyhuang_75970/what-is-bem-and-why-you-should-use-it-in-your-project-ab37c6d10b79)\r\n\r\n#### Another example\r\n\r\nWe can have a normal button for usual cases, and two more states for different ones. Because we style blocks by class selectors with BEM, we can implement them using any tags we want (button, a or even div). The naming rules tell us to use block--modifier-value syntax.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button class=\"button\">\r\n\tNormal button\r\n</button>\r\n<button class=\"button button--state-success\">\r\n\tSuccess button\r\n</button>\r\n<button class=\"button button--state-danger\">\r\n\tDanger button\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the css\r\n\r\n```\r\n.button {\r\n\tdisplay: inline-block;\r\n\tborder-radius: 3px;\r\n\tpadding: 7px 12px;\r\n\tborder: 1px solid #D5D5D5;\r\n\tbackground-image: linear-gradient(#EEE, #DDD);\r\n\tfont: 700 13px/18px Helvetica, arial;\r\n}\r\n.button--state-success {\r\n\tcolor: #FFF;\r\n\tbackground: #569E3D linear-gradient(#79D858, #569E3D) repeat-x;\r\n\tborder-color: #4A993E;\r\n}\r\n.button--state-danger {\r\n\tcolor: #900;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Furtehr Readin\r\n\r\n[http://getbem.com/naming/](http://getbem.com/naming/)\r\n"

For example:**\r\n\r\n`.foo { width: 10em; padding: 2em; border: 1em; }`\r\n\r\n**will actually be 16em wide: 10em + 2em padding for each side, + 1em border for each edge.**\r\n\r\nThis <div> element will have a total width of 350px:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiv {\r\n  width: 320px;\r\n  padding: 10px;\r\n  border: 5px solid gray;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the calculation:\r\n\r\n320px (width)\r\n\r\n-   20px (left + right padding)\r\n-   10px (left + right border)\r\n-   0px (left + right margin)\r\n    = 350px\r\n\r\nIf the box-sizing property is set to content-box (default) and if the element is a block element, then below is the formulae\r\n\r\nTotal element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin\r\n\r\n### If the width of a box is undeclared (and the box is a block level element) AND has static or relative positioning\r\n\r\nIf you don't declare a width, and the box has static or relative positioning, the width will remain 100% in width and the padding and border will push inwards instead of outward. But if you explicitly set the width of the box to be 100%, the padding will push the box outward as normal.\r\n\r\nThe lesson here being that the default width of a box isn't really 100% but a less tangible \"whatever is left\". This is particularly valuable to know, since there are lots of circumstances where it is immensely useful to either set or not set a width.\r\n\r\n### Absolute Boxes with No Width\r\n\r\nAbsolutely positioned boxes that have no width set on them behave a bit strangely. Their width is only as wide as it needs to be to hold the content. So if the box contains a single word, the box is only as wide as that word renders. If it grows to two words, it'll grow that wide.\r\n\r\nThis should continue until the box is 100% of the parent's width (the nearest parent with relative positioning, or browser window) and then begin to wrap. It feels natural and normal for boxes to expand vertically to accommodate content, but it just feels strange when it happens horizontally.\r\n\r\n### Floated Boxes With No Width\r\n\r\nThe same exact behavior is seen with floated elements with no widths. The box is only as wide as it needs to be to accommodate the content, up to as wide as its parent element (doesn't need to be relatively positioned though). Because of the fragile nature of these width-less boxes, the lesson to take away here is to not rely on them in mission-critical scenarios, like in overall page layout. If you float a column to use as a sidebar and count on some element inside (like an image) to be responsible for holding its width, you are asking for trouble.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/](https://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/)\r\n"

We assume that the browser has already determined the rules that match a particular element. Among the matching rules, the specificity, four comma-separate values, `a, b, c, d` are calculated for each rule based on the following:\r\n\r\n1. `a` is whether inline styles are being used. If the property declaration is an inline style on the element, `a` is 1, else 0.\r\n2. `b` is the number of ID selectors.\r\n3. `c` is the number of classes, attributes and pseudo-classes selectors.\r\n4. `d` is the number of tags and pseudo-elements selectors.\r\n\r\nThe resulting specificity is not a score, but a matrix of values that can be compared column by column. When comparing selectors to determine which has the highest specificity, look from left to right, and compare the highest value in each column. So a value in column `b` will override values in columns `c` and `d`, no matter what they might be. As such, specificity of `0,1,0,0` would be greater than one of `0,0,10,10`.\r\n\r\nIn the cases of equal specificity: the latest rule is the one that counts. If you have written the same rule into your stylesheet (regardless of internal or external) twice, then the lower rule in your style sheet is closer to the element to be styled, it is deemed to be more specific and therefore will be applied.\r\n\r\nI would write CSS rules with low specificity so that they can be easily overridden if necessary. When writing CSS UI component library code, it is important that they have low specificities so that users of the library can override them without using too complicated CSS rules just for the sake of increasing specificity or resorting to `!important`.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/\r\n- https://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/specificity/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### What's the difference between \"resetting\" and \"normalizing\" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?\r\n\r\n- **Resetting** - Resetting is meant to strip all default browser styling on elements. For e.g. `margin`s, `padding`s, `font-size`s of all elements are reset to be the same. You will have to redeclare styling for common typographic elements.\r\n- **Normalizing** - Normalizing preserves useful default styles rather than \"unstyling\" everything. It also corrects bugs for common browser dependencies.\r\n\r\nI would choose resetting when I have a very customized or unconventional site design such that I need to do a lot of my own styling and do not need any default styling to be preserved.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6887336/what-is-the-difference-between-normalize-css-and-reset-css\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Describe `float`s and how they work.\r\n\r\nFloat is a CSS positioning property. Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the page, and will affect the positioning of other elements (e.g. text will flow around floated elements), unlike `position: absolute` elements, which are removed from the flow of the page.\r\n\r\nThe CSS `clear` property can be used to be positioned below `left`/`right`/`both` floated elements.\r\n\r\nIf a parent element contains nothing but floated elements, its height will be collapsed to nothing. It can be fixed by clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container.\r\n\r\nThe `.clearfix` hack uses a clever CSS [pseudo selector](#describe-pseudo-elements-and-discuss-what-they-are-used-for) (`:after`) to clear floats. Rather than setting the overflow on the parent, you apply an additional class `clearfix` to it. Then apply this CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.clearfix:after {\r\n  content: \" \";\r\n  visibility: hidden;\r\n  display: block;\r\n  height: 0;\r\n  clear: both;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, give `overflow: auto` or `overflow: hidden` property to the parent element which will establish a new block formatting context inside the children and it will expand to contain its children.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Describe `z-index` and how stacking context is formed.\r\n\r\nThe `z-index` property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap. `z-index` only affects elements that have a `position` value which is not `static`.\r\n\r\nWithout any `z-index` value, elements stack in the order that they appear in the DOM (the lowest one down at the same hierarchy level appears on top). Elements with non-static positioning (and their children) will always appear on top of elements with default static positioning, regardless of HTML hierarchy.\r\n\r\nA stacking context is an element that contains a set of layers. Within a local stacking context, the `z-index` values of its children are set relative to that element rather than to the document root. Layers outside of that context — i.e. sibling elements of a local stacking context — can't sit between layers within it. If an element B sits on top of element A, a child element of element A, element C, can never be higher than element B even if element C has a higher `z-index` than element B.\r\n\r\nEach stacking context is self-contained - after the element's contents are stacked, the whole element is considered in the stacking order of the parent stacking context. A handful of CSS properties trigger a new stacking context, such as `opacity` less than 1, `filter` that is not `none`, and `transform` that is not`none`.\r\n\r\n_Note: What exactly qualifies an element to create a stacking context is listed in this long set of [rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context#The_stacking_context)._\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/z/z-index/\r\n- https://philipwalton.com/articles/what-no-one-told-you-about-z-index/\r\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Describe Block Formatting Context (BFC) and how it works.\r\n\r\nA Block Formatting Context (BFC) is part of the visual CSS rendering of a web page in which block boxes are laid out. Floats, absolutely positioned elements, `inline-blocks`, `table-cells`, `table-caption`s, and elements with `overflow` other than `visible` (except when that value has been propagated to the viewport) establish new block formatting contexts.\r\n\r\nKnowing how to establish a block formatting context is important, because without doing so, the containing box will not [contain floated children](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context#Make_float_content_and_alongside_content_the_same_height). This is similar to collapsing margins, but more insidious as you will find entire boxes collapsing in odd ways.\r\n\r\nA BFC is an HTML box that satisfies at least one of the following conditions:\r\n\r\n- The value of `float` is not `none`.\r\n- The value of `position` is neither `static` nor `relative`.\r\n- The value of `display` is `table-cell`, `table-caption`, `inline-block`, `flex`, or `inline-flex`.\r\n- The value of `overflow` is not `visible`.\r\n\r\nIn a BFC, each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block (for right-to-left formatting, right edges touch).\r\n\r\nVertical margins between adjacent block-level boxes in a BFC collapse. Read more on [collapsing margins](https://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/collapsing-margins/).\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context\r\n- https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-block-formatting-contexts-in-css/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?\r\n\r\n- Empty `div` method - `<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>`.\r\n- Clearfix method - Refer to the `.clearfix` class above.\r\n- `overflow: auto` or `overflow: hidden` method - Parent will establish a new block formatting context and expand to contains its floated children.\r\n\r\nIn large projects, I would write a utility `.clearfix` class and use them in places where I need it. `overflow: hidden` might clip children if the children is taller than the parent and is not very ideal.\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.\r\n\r\nCSS sprites combine multiple images into one single larger image. It is a commonly-used technique for icons (Gmail uses it). How to implement it:\r\n\r\n1. Use a sprite generator that packs multiple images into one and generate the appropriate CSS for it.\r\n1. Each image would have a corresponding CSS class with `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` properties defined.\r\n1. To use that image, add the corresponding class to your element.\r\n\r\n**Advantages:**\r\n\r\n- Reduce the number of HTTP requests for multiple images (only one single request is required per spritesheet). But with HTTP2, loading multiple images is no longer much of an issue.\r\n- Advance downloading of assets that won't be downloaded until needed, such as images that only appear upon `:hover` pseudo-states. Blinking wouldn't be seen.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?\r\n\r\n- After identifying the issue and the offending browser, use a separate style sheet that only loads when that specific browser is being used. This technique requires server-side rendering though.\r\n- Use libraries like Bootstrap that already handles these styling issues for you.\r\n- Use `autoprefixer` to automatically add vendor prefixes to your code.\r\n- Use Reset CSS or Normalize.css.\r\n- If you're using Postcss (or a similar transpiling library), there may be plugins which allow you to opt in for using modern CSS syntax (and even W3C proposals) that will transform those sections of your code into corresponding safe code that will work in the targets you've used.\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers? What techniques/processes do you use?\r\n\r\n- Graceful degradation - The practice of building an application for modern browsers while ensuring it remains functional in older browsers.\r\n- Progressive enhancement - The practice of building an application for a base level of user experience, but adding functional enhancements when a browser supports it.\r\n- Use [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) to check for feature support.\r\n- Autoprefixer for automatic vendor prefix insertion.\r\n- Feature detection using [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/).\r\n- Use CSS Feature queries [@support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports)\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?\r\n\r\nThese techniques are related to accessibility (a11y).\r\n\r\n- `width: 0; height: 0`. Make the element not take up any space on the screen at all, resulting in not showing it.\r\n- `position: absolute; left: -99999px`. Position it outside of the screen.\r\n- `text-indent: -9999px`. This only works on text within the `block` elements.\r\n- Meta tags. For example by using Schema.org, RDF, and JSON-LD.\r\n- WAI-ARIA. A W3C technical specification that specifies how to increase the accessibility of web pages.\r\n\r\nEven if WAI-ARIA is the ideal solution, I would go with the `absolute` positioning approach, as it has the least caveats, works for most elements and it's an easy technique.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/\r\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA\r\n- http://a11yproject.com/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?\r\n\r\nBefore Flex became popular (around 2014), the `float`-based grid system was the most reliable because it still has the most browser support among the alternative existing systems (flex, grid). Bootstrap was using the `float` approach until Bootstrap 4 which switched to the `flex`-based approach. As of writing (2020), `flex` is the recommended approach for building grid systems and has [decent browser support](https://caniuse.com/#search=flex).\r\n\r\nFor the adventurous, they can look into [CSS Grid Layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/), which uses the shiny new `grid` property; it is even better than `flex` for building grid layouts and will be the de facto way to do so in the future.\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Have you used or implemented media queries or mobile-specific layouts/CSS?\r\n\r\nYes. An example would be transforming a stacked pill navigation into a fixed-bottom tab navigation beyond a certain breakpoint.\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Are you familiar with styling SVG?\r\n\r\nYes, there are several ways to color shapes (including specifying attributes on the object) using inline CSS, an embedded CSS section, or an external CSS file. Most SVG you'll find around the web use inline CSS, but there are advantages and disadvantages associated with each type.\r\n\r\nBasic coloring can be done by setting two attributes on the node: `fill` and `stroke`. `fill` sets the color inside the object and `stroke` sets the color of the line drawn around the object. You can use the same CSS color naming schemes that you use in HTML, whether that's color names (that is `red`), RGB values (that is `rgb(255,0,0)`), Hex values, RGBA values, etc.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<rect\r\n  x=\"10\"\r\n  y=\"10\"\r\n  width=\"100\"\r\n  height=\"100\"\r\n  stroke=\"blue\"\r\n  fill=\"purple\"\r\n  fill-opacity=\"0.5\"\r\n  stroke-opacity=\"0.8\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above `fill=\"purple\"` is an example of a _presentational attribute_. Interestingly, and unlike inline styles like `style=\"fill: purple\"` which also happens to be an attribute, presentational attributes can be [overriden by CSS](https://css-tricks.com/presentation-attributes-vs-inline-styles/) styles defined in a stylesheet. So, if you did something like `svg { fill: blue; }` it would override the purple fill we've defined.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Fills_and_Strokes\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Can you give an example of an @media property other than screen?\r\n\r\nYes, there are four types of @media properties (including _screen_):\r\n\r\n- `all` - for all media type devices\r\n- `print` - for printers\r\n- `speech` - for screenreaders that \"reads\" the page out loud\r\n- `screen` - for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of `print` media type's usage:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@media print {\r\n  body {\r\n    color: black;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media#Syntax\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### What are some of the \"gotchas\" for writing efficient CSS?\r\n\r\nFirstly, understand that browsers match selectors from rightmost (key selector) to left. Browsers filter out elements in the DOM according to the key selector and traverse up its parent elements to determine matches. The shorter the length of the selector chain, the faster the browser can determine if that element matches the selector. Hence avoid key selectors that are tag and universal selectors. They match a large number of elements and browsers will have to do more work in determining if the parents do match.\r\n\r\n[BEM (Block Element Modifier)](https://bem.info/) methodology recommends that everything has a single class, and, where you need hierarchy, that gets baked into the name of the class as well, this naturally makes the selector efficient and easy to override.\r\n\r\nBe aware of which CSS properties [trigger](https://csstriggers.com/) reflow, repaint, and compositing. Avoid writing styles that change the layout (trigger reflow) where possible.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/\r\n- https://csstriggers.com/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### What are the advantages/disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors?\r\n\r\n**Advantages:**\r\n\r\n- CSS is made more maintainable.\r\n- Easy to write nested selectors.\r\n- Variables for consistent theming. Can share theme files across different projects.\r\n- Mixins to generate repeated CSS.\r\n- Sass features like loops, lists, and maps can make configuration easier and less verbose.\r\n- Splitting your code into multiple files. CSS files can be split up too but doing so will require an HTTP request to download each CSS file.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages:**\r\n\r\n- Requires tools for preprocessing. Re-compilation time can be slow.\r\n- Not writing currently and potentially usable CSS. For example, by using something like [postcss-loader](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader) with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), you can write potentially future-compatible CSS, allowing you to use things like CSS variables instead of Sass variables. Thus, you're learning new skills that could pay off if/when they become standardized.\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Describe what you like and dislike about the CSS preprocessors you have used.\r\n\r\n**Likes:**\r\n\r\n- Mostly the advantages mentioned above.\r\n- Less is written in JavaScript, which plays well with Node.\r\n\r\n**Dislikes:**\r\n\r\n- I use Sass via `node-sass`, which is a binding for LibSass written in C++. I have to frequently recompile it when switching between node versions.\r\n- In Less, variable names are prefixed with `@`, which can be confused with native CSS keywords like `@media`, `@import` and `@font-face` rule.\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### How would you implement a web design comp that uses non-standard fonts?\r\n\r\nUse `@font-face` and define `font-family` for different `font-weight`s.\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector.\r\n\r\nThis part is related to the above about [writing efficient CSS](#what-are-some-of-the-gotchas-for-writing-efficient-css). Browsers match selectors from rightmost (key selector) to left. Browsers filter out elements in the DOM according to the key selector and traverse up its parent elements to determine matches. The shorter the length of the selector chain, the faster the browser can determine if that element matches the selector.\r\n\r\nFor example with this selector `p span`, browsers firstly find all the `<span>` elements and traverse up its parent all the way up to the root to find the `<p>` element. For a particular `<span>`, as soon as it finds a `<p>`, it knows that the `<span>` matches and can stop its matching.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5797014/why-do-browsers-match-css-selectors-from-right-to-left\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what they are used for.\r\n\r\nA CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). They can be used for decoration (`::first-line`, `::first-letter`) or adding elements to the markup (combined with `content: ...`) without having to modify the markup (`:before`, `:after`).\r\n\r\n- `::first-line` and `::first-letter` can be used to decorate text.\r\n- Used in the `.clearfix` hack as shown above to add a zero-space element with `clear: both`.\r\n- Triangular arrows in tooltips use `:before` and `:after`. Encourages separation of concerns because the triangle is considered part of styling and not really the DOM.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/a/after-and-before/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Explain your understanding of the box model and how you would tell the browser in CSS to render your layout in different box models.\r\n\r\nThe CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for elements in the document tree and laid out according to the visual formatting model. Each box has a content area (e.g. text, an image, etc.) and optional surrounding `padding`, `border`, and `margin` areas.\r\n\r\nThe CSS box model is responsible for calculating:\r\n\r\n- How much space a block element takes up.\r\n- Whether or not borders and/or margins overlap, or collapse.\r\n- A box's dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe box model has the following rules:\r\n\r\n- The dimensions of a block element are calculated by `width`, `height`, `padding`, `border`s, and `margin`s.\r\n- If no `height` is specified, a block element will be as high as the content it contains, plus `padding` (unless there are floats, for which see below).\r\n- If no `width` is specified, a non-floated block element will expand to fit the width of its parent minus `padding`.\r\n- The `height` of an element is calculated by the content's `height`.\r\n- The `width` of an element is calculated by the content's `width`.\r\n- By default, `padding`s and `border`s are not part of the `width` and `height` of an element.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/the-principles-of-cross-browser-css-coding/#understand-the-css-box-model\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### What does `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` do? What are its advantages?\r\n\r\n- By default, elements have `box-sizing: content-box` applied, and only the content size is being accounted for.\r\n- `box-sizing: border-box` changes how the `width` and `height` of elements are being calculated, `border` and `padding` are also being included in the calculation.\r\n- The `height` of an element is now calculated by the content's `height` + vertical `padding` + vertical `border` width.\r\n- The `width` of an element is now calculated by the content's `width` + horizontal `padding` + horizontal `border` width.\r\n- Taking into account `padding`s and `border`s as part of our box model resonates better with how designers actually imagine content in grids.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### What is the CSS `display` property and can you give a few examples of its use?\r\n\r\n- `none`, `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `flex`, `grid`, `table`, `table-row`, `table-cell`, `list-item`.\r\n\r\n| `display`      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\r\n| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| `none`         | Does not display an element (the elementv no longer affects the layout of the document).

The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` and `z-index` properties do not apply.\r\n- `relative` - The element's position is adjusted relative to itself, without changing layout (and thus leaving a gap for the element where it would have been had it not been positioned).\r\n- `absolute` - The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to its closest positioned ancestor if any, or otherwise relative to the initial containing block. Absolutely positioned boxes can have margins, and they do not collapse with any other margins. These elements do not affect the position of other elements.\r\n- `fixed` - The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to the viewport and doesn't move when scrolled.\r\n- `sticky` - Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as `relative` positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as `fixed` positioned.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/position\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### What existing CSS frameworks have you used locally, or in production?

Add a spinner button component, as it is widely used.\r\n- **Semantic UI** - Source code structure makes theme customization extremely hard to understand. Its unconventional theming system is a pain to customize. Hardcoded config path within the vendor library. Not well-designed for overriding variables unlike in Bootstrap.\r\n- **Bulma** - A lot of non-semantic and superfluous classes and markup required. Not backward compatible. Upgrading versions breaks the app in subtle manners.\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs?\r\n\r\nYes. Flexbox is mainly meant for 1-dimensional layouts while Grid is meant for 2-dimensional layouts.\r\n\r\nFlexbox solves many common problems in CSS, such as vertical centering of elements within a container, sticky footer, etc. Bootstrap and Bulma are based on Flexbox, and it is probably the recommended way to create layouts these days. Have tried Flexbox before but ran into some browser incompatibility issues (Safari) in using `flex-grow`, and I had to rewrite my code using `inline-blocks` and math to calculate the widths in percentages, it wasn't a nice experience.\r\n\r\nGrid is by far the most intuitive approach for creating grid-based layouts (it better be!) but browser support is not wide at the moment.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Can you explain the difference between coding a website to be responsive versus using a mobile-first strategy?\r\n\r\nNote that these two 2 approaches are not exclusive.\r\n\r\nMaking a website responsive means the some elements will respond by adapting its size or other functionality according to the device's screen size, typically the viewport width, through CSS media queries, for example, making the font size smaller on smaller devices.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@media (min-width: 601px) {\r\n  .my-class {\r\n    font-size: 24px;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\r\n  .my-class {\r\n    font-size: 12px;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA mobile-first strategy is also responsive, however it agrees we should default and define all the styles for mobile devices, and only add specific responsive rules to other devices later. Following the previous example:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.my-class {\r\n  font-size: 12px;\r\n}\r\n@media (min-width: 600px) {\r\n  .my-class {\r\n    font-size: 24px;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA mobile-first strategy has 2 main advantages:\r\n\r\n- It's more performant on mobile devices, since all the rules applied for them don't have to be validated against any media queries.\r\n- It forces to write cleaner code in respect to responsive CSS rules.\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### How is responsive design different from adaptive design?\r\n\r\nBoth responsive and adaptive design attempt to optimize the user experience across different devices, adjusting for different viewport sizes, resolutions, usage contexts, control mechanisms, and so on.\r\n\r\nResponsive design works on the principle of flexibility - a single fluid website that can look good on any device. Responsive websites use media queries, flexible grids, and responsive images to create a user experience that flexes and changes based on a multitude of factors. Like a single ball growing or shrinking to fit through several different hoops.\r\n\r\nAdaptive design is more like the modern definition of progressive enhancement. Instead of one flexible design, adaptive design detects the device and other features and then provides the appropriate feature and layout based on a predefined set of viewport sizes and other characteristics. The site detects the type of device used and delivers the pre-set layout for that device. Instead of a single ball going through several different-sized hoops, you'd have several different balls to use depending on the hoop size.\r\n\r\nBoth have these methods have some issues that need to be weighed:\r\n\r\n- Responsive design can be quite challenging, as you're essentially using a single albeit responsive layout to fit all situations. How to set the media query breakpoints is one such challenge. Do you use standardized breakpoint values? Or, do you use breakpoints that make sense to your particular layout? What if that layout changes?\r\n- Adaptive design generally requires user agent sniffing, or DPI detection, etc., all of which can prove unreliable.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Apps/Design/UI_layout_basics/Responsive_design_versus_adaptive_design\r\n- http://mediumwell.com/responsive-adaptive-mobile/\r\n- https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-responsive-and-adaptive-design/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Have you ever worked with retina graphics? If so, when and what techniques did you use?\r\n\r\n_Retina_ is just a marketing term to refer to high resolution screens with a pixel ratio bigger than 1. The key thing to know is that using a pixel ratio means these displays are emulating a lower resolution screen in order to show elements with the same size. Nowadays we consider all mobile devices _retina_ defacto displays.\r\n\r\nBrowsers by default render DOM elements according to the device resolution, except for images.\r\n\r\nIn order to have crisp, good-looking graphics that make the best of retina displays we need to use high resolution images whenever possible. However using always the highest resolution images will have an impact on performance as more bytes will need to be sent over the wire.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this problem, we can use responsive images, as specified in HTML5. It requires making available different resolution files of the same image to the browser and let it decide which image is best, using the html attribute `srcset` and optionally `sizes`, for instance:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div responsive-background-image>\r\n  <img\r\n    src=\"/images/test-1600.jpg\"\r\n    sizes=\"\r\n      (min-width: 768px) 50vw,\r\n      (min-width: 1024px) 66vw,\r\n      100vw\"\r\n    srcset=\"\r\n      /images/test-400.jpg   400w,\r\n      /images/test-800.jpg   800w,\r\n      /images/test-1200.jpg 1200w\r\n    \"\r\n  />\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that browsers which don't support HTML5's `srcset` (i.e. IE11) will ignore it and use `src` instead.

Changing `transform` or `opacity` does not trigger browser reflow or repaint but does trigger compositions; whereas changing the absolute positioning triggers `reflow`. `transform` causes the browser to create a GPU layer for the element but changing absolute positioning properties uses the CPU. Hence `translate()` is more efficient and will result in shorter paint times for smoother animations.\r\n\r\nWhen using `translate()`, the element still occupies its original space (sort of like `position: relative`), unlike in changing the absolute positioning.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://www.paulirish.com/2012/why-moving-elements-with-translate-is-better-than-posabs-topleft/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Other Answers\r\n\r\n- https://neal.codes/blog/front-end-interview-css-questions\r\n- https://quizlet.com/28293152/front-end-interview-questions-css-flash-cards/\r\n- http://peterdoes.it/2015/12/03/a-personal-exercise-front-end-job-interview-questions-and-my-answers-all/\r\n"

These are the two components of any flexbox component. Any html element that is a direct child of the flexbox container, becomes a flexbox item.\r\n\r\nThe main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).\r\n\r\nA good example of turning a block to a flex-box design for few div elements - [https://vegibit.com/css-flexbox-tutorial/](https://vegibit.com/css-flexbox-tutorial/)\r\n\r\n### Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.\r\n\r\nSource - https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\r\n\r\n### A Flexible Layout must have a parent element with the display property set to flex. Like below\r\n\r\n```\r\n.flex-container {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, this is the only property you need to set on the parent container and all its immediate children will become automatically flex items.\r\n\r\nAnd then this is how generally it works - I need to add **display:flex** to the parent tag for and then **flex:1** to the child to enable the child to expand to 100% of parent.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n.fb-container {\r\n  background-color:green;\r\n  flex: 1;\r\n\r\n}\r\n.somedatadiv {\r\n  width: 75%;\r\n  max-width: 345px;\r\n  background-color: grey;\r\n  padding: 30px;\r\n}\r\n<body style=\"height:100vh;display:flex;\">\r\n  <div class=\"fb-container\">\r\n    <div class=\"somedatadiv\">\r\n      Some data\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"anotherdiv\">\r\n      data\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex container. To create a flex container, we set the value of the area's container's display property to flex or inline-flex. As soon as we do this the direct children of that container become flex items. As with all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined,\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox#The_flex_container\r\n\r\n### Direct child elements(s) of the flexible container automatically becomes flexible items.\r\n\r\n#### Basics & Terminology\r\n\r\nSince flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as \"flex container\") whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said \"flex items\").\r\n\r\nIf regular layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex layout is based on \"flex-flow directions\". Please have a look at this figure from the specification, explaining the main idea behind the flex layout.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"Flexbox-CSS.jpeg\">\r\n\r\n### Implementation of flex-end\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/rohan-paul/SignUp-Form-with-Passport/blob/master/src/App.css](https://github.com/rohan-paul/SignUp-Form-with-Passport/blob/master/src/App.css)\r\n\r\nIn the above running application -> do inspect element on the running app on Navbar login section -> In the devtool change 'flex-end' to 'flex-start' and I will see the <section className=\"navbar-section\"> which **holds home login sign up** section will move vertically up to take the top left position of the navbar\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox#Start_and_end_lines\r\n\r\nThe items are packed flush to each other toward the edge of the alignment container depending on the flex container's **cross-end** side.\r\nThis only applies to flex layout items. For items that are not children of a flex container, this value is treated like end.\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-content#Formal_syntax\r\n\r\n#### Good Sources for more detailed reading\r\n\r\n1> https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp\r\n\r\n2> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox\r\n\r\n3> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex\r\n\r\n4> https://vegibit.com/css-flexbox-tutorial/\r\n\r\n5> https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties\r\n"

Its a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module. It specifies the initial size of the flexible item, before any available space is distributed according to the flex factors. If the element is not a flexible item, the flex-basis property has no effect. flex-basis can be a number (e.g. 100px) representing a length unit, or percentage, )\r\n\r\nB) The general syntax - flex : flex-grow | flex-shrink | flex-basis\r\nAnd Default values it takes is : 0 1 auto\r\n(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex)\r\n\r\n**flex-grow** - defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up. For example, if all items have flex-grow set to 1, every child will set to an equal size inside the container. If you were to give one of the children a value of 2, that child would take up twice as much space as the others.\r\nhttps://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex-grow/\r\n\r\n**flex-shrink** - specifies the \"flex shrink factor\", which determines how much the flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items in the flex container when there isn't enough space on the row. When omitted, it is set to 1 and the flex shrink factor is multiplied by the flex basis when distributing negative space.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSO, in the example above, if I want to expand the middle element's width, I use flex-shrink to make it '2' instead of '1'\r\n\r\nC) The general way flex work - You need to add display:flex to the parent tag for and then flex:1 to the child to enable the child to expand to 100% of parent.\r\n\r\nflex - This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. Default is 0 1 auto.\r\n"

It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) and to that elements children (which become Grid Items).\r\n\r\nSource: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/\r\n\r\nCSS Grid Layout (aka \"Grid\"), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces.\r\nCSS has always been used to lay out our web pages, but it's never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance). Flexbox helped out, but it's intended for simpler one-dimensional layouts, not complex two-dimensional ones (Flexbox and Grid actually work very well together). Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we've all been hacking our way around for as long as we've been making websites.\r\n\r\nLike tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows. However, many more layouts are either possible or easier with CSS grid than they were with tables. For example, a grid container's child elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned elements.\r\n\r\n[https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)\r\n[https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp)\r\n\r\n#### Some terminologies\r\n\r\n### 1\r\n\r\ngrid-column-start\r\ngrid-column-end\r\ngrid-row-start\r\ngrid-row-end\r\n\r\nDetermines a grid item's location within the grid by referring to specific grid lines. grid-column-start/grid-row-start is the line where the item begins, and grid-column-end/grid-row-end is the line where the item ends.\r\n\r\n### grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap\r\n\r\nThe grid-column-gap property sets the gap between the columns:\r\nThe grid-row-gap property sets the gap between the rows:\r\n\r\n### grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows\r\n\r\nDefines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values.

You use the same properties to specify the position of an absolutely positioned box, but the way you use them is quite different.\r\n\r\nFor a relatively positioned element, the four properties specify the relative distance to shift the generated box.

Here, all four properties can be used at the same time, to specify the distance from each edge of the positioned element to the corresponding edge of the containing block. You can also specify the position of one of the corners of the absolutely positioned box—say by using top and left—and then specify the dimensions of the box using width and height (or just use no width and height if you want to let it shrink-wrap to fit its contents).\r\n"

Essentially, its just another selector of any kind. `:not` matches an element that is not represented by the argument. The passed argument may not contain additional selectors or any pseudo-element selectors.\r\n\r\nA **simple selector** is classified as a Type Selector, Universal Selector, Attribute Selector, Class Selector, ID Selector, or Pseudo Class Selector.\r\n\r\nIn this example we have an unordered list with a single class on the li:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li></li>\r\n\t<li class=\"different\"></li>\r\n\t<li></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur CSS would select all the <li> elements except the one(s) with a class of .different.\r\n\r\nStyle everything but the `.different` class\r\n\r\n```css\r\nli:not(.different) {\r\n\tfont-size: 3em;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe specificity of the :not pseudo class is the specificity of its argument. The :not() pseudo class does not add to the selector specificity, unlike other pseudo-classes.\r\n\r\nNegations may not be nested so :not(:not(...)) is never permitted. Authors should also note that since pseudo elements are not considered a simple selector, they are not valid as an argument to :not(X). Be mindful when using attribute selectors as some are not widely supported as others. Chaining :not selectors with other :not selectors is permissible.\r\n\r\n### An interesting real-world example\r\n\r\nIn the context of `mat-slide-toggle` Very starangly the below one WAS ONLY working with `!important`. Here all I wanted to do when mat-checked or mat-toggled then,\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.mat-slide-toggle.mat-checked .mat-slide-toggle-bar {\r\n\tbackground-color: $light-text-color !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.mat-slide-toggle.mat-checked .mat-slide-toggle-thumb {\r\n\tbackground-color: mat-color($sd-theme-primary, 400) !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the reason of using `!important` here was - we have used ViewEncapsulation.None in the relevant component where I was invoking `mat-slide-toggle` making the .scss styles in this component global to the whole application.\r\n\r\nWe could avoid `!important`, by using /deep/ (which is deprecated) or ::ng-deep (which will also be deprecated in future) in the local component's css files but both these implementations are not recommended.\r\n\r\nBut then looking at mat-slide-toggle's source code - It seems like we should not need to use !important,\r\n\r\n[material/slide-toggle/\\_slide-toggle-theme.scss#L12](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/material/slide-toggle/_slide-toggle-theme.scss#L12)\r\n\r\nThey are not using `!important`. So why do we need it?\r\n\r\nSO I CHANGED AS BELOW AND IT WORKED - WHEN I BROUGHT IN EXTRA selector .mat-disabled. So in below I am saying, in addition to the other class selector, IT ALSO SHOULD NOT BE `.mat-disabled`\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.mat-slide-toggle.mat-checked:not(.mat-disabled) .mat-slide-toggle-bar {\r\n\tbackground-color: $light-text-color;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n"

However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.**\r\n\r\nNote: A \"positioned\" element is one whose position is anything except static.\r\n\r\nThis is a very powerful type of positioning that allows you to literally place any page element exactly where you want it. You use the positioning attributes top, left, bottom. and right to set the location. Remember that these values will be relative to the next parent element with relative (or absolute) positioning. If there is no such parent, it will default all the way back up to the <html> element itself meaning it will be placed relatively to the page itself.\r\n\r\nThe trade-off (and most important thing to remember) about absolute positioning is that these elements are removed from the flow of elements on the page. An element with this type of positioning is not affected by other elements and it doesn't affect other elements. This is a serious thing to consider every time you use absolute positioning. Its overuse or improper use can limit the flexibility of your site.\r\n\r\nAbsolute positioning tells the browser that whatever is going to be positioned should be removed from the normal flow of the document and will be placed in an exact location on the page. It won't affect how the elements before it or after it in the HTML are positioned on the Web page however it will be subject to it's parents' positioning unless you override it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to position an element 10 pixels from the top of the document window, you would use the top offset to position it there with absolute positioning:\r\n\r\nposition: absolute;\r\ntop: 10px;\r\nThis element will then always display 10px from the top of the page regardless of what content passes through, under or over the element (visually).\r\n\r\n### Absolute vs Fixed\r\n\r\nAbsolutely positioned elements are removed entirely from the document flow. That means they have no effect at all on their parent element or on the elements that occur after them in the source code. An absolutely positioned element will therefore overlap other content unless you take action to prevent it. Sometimes, of course, this overlap is exactly what you desire, but you should be aware of it, to make sure you are getting the layout you want!\r\n\r\nAn element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.\r\n\r\nFixed positioning is really just a specialized form of absolute positioning; elements with fixed positioning are fixed relative to the viewport/browser window rather than the containing element; even if the page is scrolled, they stay in exactly the same position inside the browser window.\r\n\r\n## Relative.\r\n\r\nThis type of positioning is probably the most confusing and misused. What it really means is \"relative to itself\". If you set position: relative; on an element but no other positioning attributes (top, left, bottom or right), it will no effect on it's positioning at all, it will be exactly as it would be if you left it as position: static; But if you do give it some other positioning attribute, say, top: 10px;, it will shift its position 10 pixels down from where it would normally be.\r\n\r\n## Use “relative” positioning with no displacement (just setting position: relative) to make an element a frame of reference, so that you can use “absolute” positioning for elements that are inside it\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n\r\nAn HTML element positioned fixed is relative to the viewport and not to any other element.\r\n\r\n#### Containing blocks\r\n\r\nAn essential concept when it comes to absolute positioning is the containing block: the block box that the position and dimensions of the absolutely positioned box are relative to. For static boxes and relatively positioned boxes the containing block is the nearest block-level ancestor—the parent element in other words. For absolutely positioned elements however it’s a little more complicated. In this case the containing block is the nearest positioned ancestor. By “positioned” I mean an element whose position property is set to relative, absolute or fixed—in other words, anything except normal static elements.\r\n\r\nSo, by setting position:relative for an element you make it the containing block for any absolutely positioned descendant (child elements), whether they appear immediately below the relatively positioned element in the hierarchy, or further down the hierarchy.\r\n\r\nIf an absolutely positioned element has no positioned ancestor, then the containing block is something called the “initial containing block,” which in practice equates to the html element. If you are looking at the web page on screen, this means the browser window; if you are printing the page, it means the page boundary.\r\n\r\nElements with fixed positioning differ from this slightly—they always have the initial containing block as their containing block.\r\n\r\nSo, let’s summarize this in a set of easy steps—to find the containing block for an element with position:absolute , this is what you need to do:\r\n\r\nLook at the parent element of the absolutely positioned element—does that element’s position property have one of the values relative, absolute or fixed?\r\nIf so, you’ve found the containing block.\r\nIf not, move to the parent’s parent element and repeat from step 1 until you find the containing block or run out of ancestors.\r\nIf you’ve reached the html element without finding a positioned ancestor, then the containing block is the html element.\r\n\r\n## More sources to read\r\n\r\n1> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10426497/position-relative-vs-absolute\r\n\r\n2> http://blog.troygrosfield.com/2013/02/11/working-with-css-positions-creating-a-simple-progress-bar/\r\n\r\n3> https://css-tricks.com/absolute-relative-fixed-positioining-how-do-they-differ/\r\n"

But instead of basing the position of the element upon the browser view port, it starts from where the element would be if it were still in the normal flow.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have three paragraphs on your Web page, and the third has a position: relative style placed on it, its position will be offset based on its current location-- not from the original sides of the view port.\r\n\r\nParagraph 1.\r\n\r\nParagraph 2.\r\n\r\nParagraph 3.\r\nIn the above example, the third paragraph will be positioned 3em from the left side of the container element, but will still be below the first two paragraphs. It would remain in the normal flow of the document, and just be offset slightly. If you changed it to position: absolute;, anything following it would display on top of it, because it would no longer be in the normal flow of the document.\r\n\r\nAs an example, if you have a division that is positioned using a value of relative and inside that division, you have a paragraph that you want to position 50 pixels from the top of the division, you add a position value of absolute to that paragraph along with an offset value of 50px on the top property, like this:\r\n\r\nposition: absolute;\r\ntop: 50px;\r\nThis absolutely positioned element always display 50 pixels from the top of that relatively positioned division, no matter what else displays there in normal flow. Your absolutely positioned element uses the relatively positioned one as its context, and the positioning value you use is relative to that.\r\n\r\n[https://www.lifewire.com/absolute-vs-relative-3466208](https://www.lifewire.com/absolute-vs-relative-3466208)\r\n"

For example, If there is a div element defined with font-size: 16px then for that div and for its children 1em = 16px.\r\nIf font-size is not defined explicitly, that element will inherit it from the parent element. The inheritance continues to take place this way amongst ancestors up until the root element. Default font-size of the root element is provided by browser.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use em for your units, you have to be careful with your layout. It is a good practice not to define font-size explicitly except root element while using em in your project.\r\n\r\n#### What is rem unit\r\n\r\n**rem** stands for **root em**. The **rem** unit is relative to the root-or the html-element. That means that we can define a single font size on the html element and define all rem units to be a percentage of that.”.\r\n\r\n**Converstion from px to rem**\r\n\r\nIn most modern browsers, 1 rem is equal to 16 pixels. So with a base size of 1rem (a.k.a. 16px) set, we can now use simple division to figure out proper sizing of elements. A headline that is 24px in Sketch is coded as 1.5rem because you take 24px and divide it by the base font size of 16px.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to spacing and font-sizing, I prefer to use rem. Since rem uses root element’s font-size instead of its parent’s font-size.\r\nLet’s assume, font-size: 10px is set for the root element which makes 1rem = 10px everywhere in our webpage. Since 1px = 0.1rem, calculations are easy.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/code-better/css-units-for-font-size-px-em-rem-79f7e592bb97](https://medium.com/code-better/css-units-for-font-size-px-em-rem-79f7e592bb97)\r\n"

If the stack is empty it takes the first thing on the queue and pushes it on to the stack which effectively run it. So here we can see that now the stack is clear, there's a callback on the task queue, the event loop runs, it says, oh, I get to do something, pushes the callback on to the stack.\r\n\r\n- Push main() onto the call stack.\r\n- Push console.log() onto the call stack. This then runs right away, and gets popped.\r\n- Push setTimeout(2000) onto the stack. setTimeout(2000) is a Node API. When we call it, we register the event-callback pair. The event will wait 2000 milliseconds, then callback is the function.\r\n- After registering it in the APIs, setTimeout(2000) gets popped from the call stack.\r\n- Now the second setTimeout(0) gets registered in the same way. We now have two Node APIs waiting to execute.\r\n- After waiting for 0 seconds, setTimeout(0) gets moved to the callback queue, and the same thing happens with setTimeout(2000).\r\n- In the callback queue, the functions wait for the call stack to be empty, because only one statement can execute a time.This is taken care of by the event loop.\r\n- The last console.log() runs, and the main() gets popped from the call stack.\r\n- The event loop sees that the call stack is empty and the callback queue is not empty. So it moves the callbacks (in a first-in-first-out order) to the call stack for execution.\r\n\r\n### Key points in Summary\r\n\r\nAny of the web APIs pushes the callback on to the task queue when it's done.\r\nThe event loop is like the simplest little piece in this whole equation, and it has one very simple job.\r\nThe event loop's job is to look at the stack and look at the task queue. If the stack is empty it takes the first thing on the task-queue and pushes it on to the stack which effectively run it. When the event loop sees that the stack is clear, there's a callback on the task queue, the event loop runs, it says, oh, I get to do something, pushes the callback on to the stack.\r\n\r\n#### A side point - Most of what you write in JavaScript, that is NOT asynchronous code, is Synchronous procedural code read from top to bottom and executed in the single main thread of the JavaScript process. Because, at its base, JavaScript is a synchronous, blocking, single-threaded language.\r\n"

So that’s how node is non-blocking.\r\n\r\nAnd whatever was transferred to the separate queue for those callbacks will be executed on a FIFO basis, so the code that was in the queue first, will return its result first. And then the next one in the queue.\r\n\r\n## 2> https://codeburst.io/how-node-js-single-thread-mechanism-work-understanding-event-loop-in-nodejs-230f7440b0ea\r\n\r\nSome of the popular server side technology like PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby & Java Servers all follow Multi-threaded where each client request results in the instantiation of a new thread or even a process, but in Node.js, requests are run on the same thread.\r\n\r\n## 3> Single Threaded Event Loop Model Processing Steps:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.journaldev.com/7462/node-js-architecture-single-threaded-event-loop\r\n\r\n- Clients Send request to Web Server.\r\n\r\n- Node JS Web Server internally maintains a Limited Thread pool (4 by default) to provide services to the Client Requests.\r\n\r\n- Node JS Web Server receives those requests and places them into a Queue. It is known as “Event Queue”.\r\n\r\n- Node JS Web Server internally has a Component, known as “Event Loop”. It uses indefinite loop to receive requests and process them.\r\n\r\n- **Event Loop uses Single Thread only**. It is the main heart of Node JS Architecture.\r\n\r\n- Event Loop checks if any Client Request is placed in the Event Queue. If no, then waits for incoming requests indefinitely.\r\n\r\n- If yes, then picks up one Client Request from Event Queue\r\n\r\n- Starts processing that Client Request\r\n\r\n- If that Client Request Does Not requires any Blocking IO Operations, then processes everything, prepares response and sends it back to client.\r\n\r\n- If that Client Request requires some Blocking IO Operations like interacting with Database, File System, External Services then it will follow different approach as below\r\n\r\n    - A) Checks Threads availability from Internal Thread Pool\r\n\r\n    - B) Picks up one Thread and assign this Client Request to that thread.\r\n\r\n    - C) That Thread is responsible for taking that request, process it, perform Blocking IO operations, prepare response and sending it back to the Event Loop - PAUL NOTE - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT KEY POINT\r\n\r\n    - D) Event Loop in turn, sends that Response to the respective Client.\r\n\r\n\r\n# ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ABOVE EVENT-LOOP-CALLBACK PROCESS\r\n\r\n- Say “n” number of Clients Send request to Web Server. Let us assume they are accessing our Web Application concurrently.\r\n\r\n- Let us assume, our Clients are Client-1, Client-2… and Client-n.\r\n- Web Server internally maintains a Limited Thread pool. Let us assume “m” number of Threads in Thread pool.\r\n- Node JS Web Server receives Client-1, Client-2… and Client-n Requests and places them in the Event Queue.\r\n- Node JS Even Loop Picks up those requests one by one.\r\n- Even Loop pickups Client-1 Request-1\r\n- Checks whether Client-1 Request-1 does require any Blocking IO Operations or takes more time for complex computation tasks.\r\n- As this request is simple computation and Non-Blocking IO task, it does not require separate Thread to process it.\r\n- Event Loop process all steps provided in that Client-1 Request-1 Operation (Here Operations means Java Script’s functions) and prepares Response-1\r\n- Event Loop sends Response-1 to Client-1\r\n- Even Loop pickups Client-2 Request-2\r\n- Checks whether Client-2 Request-2does require any Blocking IO Operations or takes more time for complex computation tasks.\r\n- As this request is simple computation and Non-Blocking IO task, it does not require separate Thread to process it.\r\n- Event Loop process all steps provided in that Client-2 Request-2 Operation and prepares Response-2\r\n- Event Loop sends Response-2 to Client-2\r\n- Even Loop pickups Client-n Request-n\r\n- Checks whether Client-n Request-n does require any Blocking IO Operations or takes more time for complex computation tasks.\r\n- As this request is very complex computation or Blocking IO task, Even Loop does not process this request.\r\n- Event Loop picks up Thread T-1 from Internal Thread pool and assigns this Client-n Request-n to Thread T-1\r\n- Thread T-1 reads and process Request-n, perform necessary Blocking IO or Computation task, and finally prepares Response-n\r\n- Thread T-1 sends this Response-n to Event Loop\r\n- Event Loop in turn, sends this Response-n to Client-n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere Client Request is a call to one or more Java Script Functions. Java Script Functions may call other functions or may utilize its Callback functions nature.\r\n\r\nSo Each Client Request looks like as shown below:\r\n\r\nfunction (other-function, callback-function)\r\n\r\n## So in a nutshell - event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operation, despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded & by offloads operations to the system kernel whenever possible. So, the question is if Node pushes all those responsibilities down to the kernel then why would a thread pool be needed?” It’s so because the kernel doesn’t support doing everything asynchronously. In those cases Node has to lock a thread for the duration of the operation so it can continue executing the event loop without blocking.\r\n\r\n## [Official Doc](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/) - Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background. When one of these operations completes, the kernel tells Node.js so that the appropriate callback may be added to the poll queue to eventually be executed.\r\n\r\n## 2> https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2016/12/concurrency-and-node\r\n\r\nWhen Node.JS first came onto the scene it successfully popularized the event-loop. Ryan Dahl correctly identified a serious problem with the way that I/O is generally handled in concurrent environments. Many web servers, for example achieve concurrency by creating a new thread for every connection. In most platforms, this comes at a substantial cost. The default stack size in Java is 512KB, which means that if you have 1000 concurrent connections, your program will consume half a gigabyte of memory just for stack space. Additionally, forking threads in most systems costs an enormous amount of time, as does performing a context switch between two threads.\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, Node.JS uses a single thread with an event-loop. In this way, Node can handle 1000s of concurrent connections without any of the traditional detriments associated with threads. There is essentially no memory overhead per-connection, and there is no context switching.\r\n\r\nGeneral Read\r\n\r\n1> https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/what-you-should-know-to-really-understand-the-node-js-event-loop-and-its-metrics-c4907b19da4c\r\n\r\n There is only one thread that executes JavaScript code and this is the thread where the event loop is running. The execution of callbacks (know that every userland code in a running Node.js application is a callback) is done by the event loop.\r\n\r\n\r\n2> Great example - https://codeburst.io/how-node-js-single-thread-mechanism-work-understanding-event-loop-in-nodejs-230f7440b0ea\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar sockets = require('websocket.io');\r\n\r\n    httpServer = sockets.listen(4000);\r\n\r\n\thttpServer.on('onConnection', function(socket) {\r\n\r\n\tconsole.log('connected……');\r\n\r\n\thttpServer.send('Web socket connected.');\r\n\r\n\thttpServer.on('message', function(data) {\r\n\r\n\t\tconsole.log('message received:', data);\r\n\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\thttpServer.on('close', function() {\r\n\r\n\t\tconsole.log('socket closed!');\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere when sockets.listen(4000) executes, a Web-Socket server is created on a single thread — event loop which listens continuously on port 4000. When a web or app client connects to it, it fires the ‘onConnection’ event which the loop picks up and immediately publishes to the thread pool and is ready to receive the next request and this is the main functionality differentiation between NodeJs based servers and other IIS/ Apache based servers, NodeJs for every connection request do not create a new thread instead it receives all request on single thread and delegates it to be handled by many background workers to do the task as required. Libuv library handles this workers in collaboration with OS kernel. Libuv is the magical library that handles the queueing and processing of asynchronous events utilizing powerful kernel, today most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background. When one of these operations completes, the kernel tells Node.js so that the appropriate callback may be added to the poll queue to eventually be executed.\r\n\r\nNode has a pool of Thread and you must be scratching your head wondering if Node pushes all those responsibilities down to the kernel then why would a thread pool be needed?” It’s so because the kernel doesn’t support doing everything asynchronously. In those cases Node has to lock a thread for the duration of the operation so it can continue executing the event loop without blocking.\r\n\r\n## 3> node.js handle thousands of concurrent requests per second, when writing them to Mongo?\r\n\r\nGenerally the web server and the database server are 2 different machines, because of Async nature, the event loop gets free after forwarding the read/write request to database server. That is why, a Node JS HTTP server can handle a large number of requests while the process of complex read/write operations could be in-progress on database server(s).\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n- 1.

        "content": "# Callbacks - How exactly the flow of non-blocking code works in Node\r\n\r\n## Callbacks are functions that are executed asynchronously, or at a later time. Instead of the code reading top to bottom procedurally, async programs may execute different functions at different times based on the order and speed that earlier functions like http requests or file system reads happen.\r\n\r\nThe difference can be confusing since determining if a function is asynchronous or not depends a lot on context. Here is a simple synchronous example, meaning you can read the code top to bottom just like a book:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myNumber = 1\r\nfunction addOne() { myNumber++ } // define the function\r\naddOne() // run the function\r\nconsole.log(myNumber) // logs out 2\r\n```\r\nThe code here defines a function and then on the next line calls that function, without waiting for anything. When the function is called it immediately adds 1 to the number, so we can expect that after we call the function the number should be 2. This is the expectation of synchronous code - it sequentially runs top to bottom.\r\n\r\n### Check the .js file in ./code/Non-blocking-mechanism.js\r\n\r\nNode, however, uses mostly asynchronous code. Let's use node to read our number from a file called `number.txt`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst fs = require('fs'); // for requiring this, I dont need any separate package.json as my machine is already running in node env\r\nvar myNumber = undefined;\r\n\r\naddOne = callbackFunction => {\r\n    fs.readFile('number.txt', doneReading = (err, fileContent) => {\r\n        myNumber = parseInt(fileContent);\r\n        myNumber++\r\n        callbackFunction()\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n\r\nlogMyNumberFromCallback = () => {\r\n    return console.log(myNumber);\r\n}\r\n\r\naddOne(logMyNumberFromCallback); // => 2\r\n\r\n// The below line will get executed first (before readFile is done) logging out 'undefined' -- Even thought its placed after addOne() in the top-down flow in this file - This is because when readFile() is non-blocking, meaning when its doing its job of reading the number.txt file, the code right below its execution block will continue to get executed  */\r\n\r\nconsole.log(myNumber) // => undefined\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhy do we get `undefined` when we log out the number this time? In this code we use the `fs.readFile` method, which happens to be an asynchronous method. Usually things that have to talk to hard drives or networks will be asynchronous. If they just have to access things in memory or do some work on the CPU they will be synchronous. The reason for this is that I/O is reallyyy reallyyy sloowwww. A ballpark figure would be that talking to a hard drive is about 100,000 times slower than talking to memory (e.g. RAM).\r\n\r\nWhen we run this program all of the functions are immediately defined, but they don't all execute immediately. This is a fundamental thing to understand about async programming. When `addOne` is called it kicks off a `readFile` and then moves on to the next thing that is ready to execute. If there is nothing to execute node will either wait for pending fs/network operations to finish or it will stop running and exit to the command line.\r\nWhen `readFile` is done reading the file (this may take anywhere from milliseconds to seconds to minutes depending on how fast the hard drive is) it will run the `doneReading` function and give it an error (if there was an error) and the file contents.\r\nThe reason we got `undefined` above is that nowhere in our code exists logic that tells the `console.log` statement to wait until the `readFile` statement finishes before it prints out the number.\r\n\r\nIf you have some code that you want to be able to execute over and over again, or at a later time, the first step is to put that code inside a function. Then you can call the function whenever you want to run your code. It helps to give your functions descriptive names.\r\n\r\nCallbacks are just functions that get executed at some later time. The key to understanding callbacks is to realize that they are used when you don't know **when** some async operation will complete, but you do know **where** the operation will complete — the last line of the async function! The top-to-bottom order that you declare callbacks does not necessarily matter, only the logical/hierarchical nesting of them. First you split your code up into functions, and then use callbacks to declare if one function depends on another function finishing.\r\n\r\nThe `fs.readFile` method is provided by node, is asynchronous, and happens to take a long time to finish. Consider what it does: it has to go to the operating system, which in turn has to go to the file system, which lives on a hard drive that may or may not be spinning at thousands of revolutions per minute. Then it has to use a magnetic head to read data and send it back up through the layers back into your javascript program. You give `readFile` a function (known as a callback) that it will call after it has retrieved the data from the file system. It puts the data it retrieved into a javascript variable and calls your function (callback) with that variable. In this case the variable is called `fileContents` because it contains the contents of the file that was read.\r\n\r\n### Now the `logMyNumberFromCallback` function can get passed in as an argument that will become the `callbackFunction` variable inside the `addOne` function. ONLY After `readFile` is done the `callbackFunction` variable will be invoked (the variable being a function here `callbackFunction()`). Only functions can be invoked, so if you pass in anything other than a function it will cause an error.\r\n\r\n### When a function gets invoked in javascript the code inside that function will immediately get executed. In this case our log statement will execute since `callbackFunction` is actually `logMyNumberFromCallback`.\r\n\r\n## To break down this example even more\r\n\r\n### Invoking `addOne` will first run the asynchronous `fs.readFile` function. This part of the program takes a while to finish.\r\n\r\n### As soon as `readFile` finishes it executes its callback, `doneReading`, which parses `fileContent` for an integer called `myNumber`, increments `myNumber` and then immediately invokes the function that `addOne` passed in (its callback), `logMyNumberFromCallback` > which in turn just logs out the incremented `myNumber`.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most confusing part of programming with callbacks is how functions are just objects that can be stored in variables and passed around with different names.\r\n\r\nThis is an example 'evented programming' or 'event loop'. They refer to the way that `readFile` is implemented. Node first dispatches the `readFile` operation and then waits for `readFile` to send it an event that it has completed. While it is waiting node can go check on other things.\r\n\r\nInside node there is a list of things that are dispatched but haven't reported back yet, so node loops over the list again and again checking to see if they are finished. After they finished they get 'processed', e.g. any callbacks that depended on them finishing will get invoked.\r\nHere is a pseudocode version of the above example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction addOne(thenRunThisFunction) {\r\n  waitAMinuteAsync(function waitedAMinute() {\r\n    thenRunThisFunction()\r\n  })\r\n}\r\naddOne(function thisGetsRunAfterAddOneFinishes() {})\r\n```\r\n\r\nImagine you had 3 async functions a, b and c. Each one takes 1 minute to run and after it finishes it calls a callback (that gets passed in the first argument). If you wanted to tell node 'start running a, then run b after a finishes, and then run c after b finishes' it would look like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\na(function() {\r\n  b(function() {\r\n    c()\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```\r\nWhen this code gets executed, a will immediately start running, then a minute later it will finish and call b, then a minute later it will finish and call c and finally 3 minutes later node will stop running since there would be nothing more to do. There are definitely more elegant ways to write the above example, but the point is that if you have code that has to wait for some other async code to finish then you express that dependency by putting your code in functions that get passed around as callbacks.\r\n\r\nThe design of node requires you to think non-linearly. Consider this list of operations:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nread a file\r\nprocess that file\r\nIf you were to turn this into pseudocode you would end up with this:\r\n\r\nvar file = readFile()\r\nprocessFile(file)\r\n```\r\nThis kind of linear (step-by-step, in order) code isn't the way that node works. If this code were to get executed then readFile and processFile would both get executed at the same exact time. This doesn't make sense since readFile will take a while to complete. Instead you need to express that processFile depends on readFile finishing. This is exactly what callbacks are for! And because of the way that JavaScript works you can write this dependency many different ways:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar fs = require('fs')\r\n\r\nfs.readFile('movie.mp4', function finishedReading(error, movieData) {\r\n  if (error) return console.error(error)\r\n  // do something with the movieData\r\n})\r\n```"

But first — what’s a stack? A stack is an array-like data structure but with some limitations — you can only add items to the back and only remove the last item. Another example is a pile of plates — you put them on top of each other and at any time you can only remove the top one.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re about to execute a function it is added on the call stack. Then if that function calls another function — the other function will be on top of the first one in the call stack.\r\n\r\n#### The Event Table & Event Queue\r\n\r\nEvery time you call a setTimeout function or you do some async operation — it is added to the Event Table. This is a data structure which knows that a certain function should be triggered after a certain event. Once that event occurs (timeout, click, mouse move) it sends a notice. Bear in mind that the Event Table does not execute functions and does not add them to the call stack on it’s own. It’s sole purpose is to keep track of events and send them to the Event Queue.\r\n\r\nThe Event Queue is a data structure similar to the stack — again you add items to the back but can only remove them from the front. It kind of stores the correct order in which the functions should be executed. It receives the function calls from the Event Table, but it needs to somehow send them to the Call Stack? This is where the Event Loop comes in.\r\n\r\n#### The Event Loop\r\n\r\nWe’ve finally reached the infamous Event Loop. This is a constantly running process that checks if the call stack is empty. Imagine it like a clock and every time it ticks it looks at the Call Stack and if it is empty it looks into the Event Queue. If there is something in the event queue that is waiting it is moved to the call stack. If not, then nothing happens.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n- 1.

When one of these operations completes, the kernel tells Node.js so that the appropriate callback may be added to the poll queue to eventually be executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Event Loop vs Worker Pool (Thread Pool)\r\n\r\n[https://nodejs.org/ja/docs/guides/dont-block-the-event-loop/(https://nodejs.org/ja/docs/guides/dont-block-the-event-loop/)\r\n\r\nNode.js runs JavaScript code in the **Event Loop (initialization and callbacks), and offers a Worker Pool to handle expensive tasks like file I/O**.\r\n\r\nNode scales well, sometimes better than more heavyweight approaches like Apache. The secret to Node's scalability is that it uses a small number of threads to handle many clients. If Node can make do with fewer threads, then it can spend more of your system's time and memory working on clients rather than on paying space and time overheads for threads (memory, context-switching).\r\n\r\n#### In Node there are two types of threads: one Event Loop (aka the main loop, main thread, event thread, etc.), and a pool of k Workers in a Worker Pool (aka the Thread Pool). When a new request comes to Node, it uses a pre-allocated set of threads called 'Thread Pool'\r\n\r\n**Node uses the Event-Driven Architecture: it has an Event Loop for orchestration and a Worker Pool for expensive tasks.**\r\n\r\n**Event Loop executes the JavaScript callbacks registered for events, and is also responsible for fulfilling non-blocking asynchronous requests like network I/O.**\r\n\r\n#### What code runs on the Worker Pool / Thread Pool ?\r\n\r\nNode's Worker Pool is implemented in libuv [docs](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/threadpool.html), which exposes a general task submission API.\r\n\r\nNode uses the Worker Pool to handle \"expensive\" tasks. This includes I/O for which an operating system does not provide a non-blocking version, as well as particularly CPU-intensive tasks.\r\n\r\nEvent loop is the mechanism that takes callbacks (functions) and registers them to be executed at some point in the future. It operates in the same thread as the proper JavaScript code. When a JavaScript operation blocks the thread, the event loop is blocked as well.\r\n\r\nWorker pool is an execution model that spawns and handles separate threads, which then synchronously perform the task and return the result to the event loop. The event loop then executes the provided callback with said result.\r\n\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n#### Explanation - 2\r\n\r\nNode runs in a single event loop. It's single threaded, and you only ever get that one thread. All of the javascript you write executes in this loop, and if a blocking operation happens in that code, then it will block the entire loop and nothing else will happen until it finishes. This is the typically single threaded nature of node that you hear so much about. But, it's not the whole picture.\r\n\r\nCertain functions and modules, usually written in C/C++, support asynchronous I/O. When you call these functions and methods, they internally manage passing the call on to a worker thread. For instance, when you use the fs module to request a file, the fs module passes that call on to a worker thread, and that worker waits for its response, which it then presents back to the event loop that has been churning on without it in the meantime. All of this is abstracted away from you, the node developer, and some of it is abstracted away from the module developers through the use of [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv).\r\n\r\n##### Misconception 1: The event loop runs in a separate thread than the user code -\r\n\r\nMany think, there is a main thread where the JavaScript code of the user (userland code) runs in and another one that runs the event loop. Every time an asynchronous operation takes place, the main thread will hand over the work to the event loop thread and once it is done, the event loop thread will ping the main thread to execute a callback.\r\n\r\n#### Reality\r\n**There is only one thread that executes JavaScript code AND ALSO the the event loop. The execution of callbacks (know that every userland code in a running Node.js application is a callback) is done by the event loop.**\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Misconception 2: Everything that’s asynchronous is handled by a thread pool/Worker Pool\r\n\r\nAsynchronous operations, like working with the filesystems, doing outbound HTTP requests or talking to databases are always loaded off to a thread pool provided by libuv.\r\n\r\n#### Reality\r\n\r\nLibuv by default creates a thread pool with four threads to offload asynchronous work to. Today’s operating systems already provide asynchronous interfaces for many I/O tasks (e.g. AIO on Linux).\r\nWhenever possible, libuv will use those asynchronous interfaces, avoiding usage of the thread pool. The same applies to third party subsystems like databases. Here the authors of the driver will rather use the asynchronous interface than utilizing a thread pool.\r\nIn short: Only if there is no other way, the thread pool will be used for asynchronous I/O.\r\n\r\n#### The above is supported in this [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22644328/when-is-the-thread-pool-used) question.\r\n\r\nthe strategy used by libuv to achieve asynchronous I/O is not always a thread pool, specifically in the case of the http module a different strategy appears to be used at this time. For our purposes here it's mainly important to note how the asynchronous context is achieved (by using libuv) and that the thread pool maintained by libuv is one of multiple strategies offered by that library to achieve asynchronicity.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n- 1. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22644328/when-is-the-thread-pool-used\r\n- 2."

This is because any function given to the setTimeout function will be executed asynchronously, when the main thread is not busy anymore.\r\n\r\nInvoking setTimeout with a callback, and zero as the second argument will schedule the callback to be run asynchronously, after the shortest possible delay.\r\n\r\nJavaScript is single-threaded. If some block of code uses execution thread, no other code can be executed. This means your setTimeout() call must wait until main execution finishes.\r\n\r\n[https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/347/javascript-promises-mastering-the-asynchronous/what-is-asynchronous-in-javascript](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/347/javascript-promises-mastering-the-asynchronous/what-is-asynchronous-in-javascript)\r\n\r\n[Official MDN Doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout)\r\n\r\n**Code executed by setTimeout() is called from an execution context separate from the function from which setTimeout was called. The usual rules for setting the `this` keyword for the called function apply, and if you have not set `this` in the call or with bind, it will default to the global (or window) object in non–strict mode, or be undefined in strict mode. It will not be the same as the `this` value for the function that called setTimeout.**\r\n\r\n### What actually happens is that an event is pushed onto the event queue that's set to execute in the number of milliseconds specified by the second argument to SetTimeout/SetInterval. The consequence of this is that if you request a 1000ms delay, then 1000ms is the MINIMUM delay you'll get. If the execution engine is busy doing something else when the 1000ms delay is over then it will have to wait until it's done with what it's doing.\r\n\r\nSince JavaScript can only ever execute one piece of code at a time (due to its single-threaded nature) each of these blocks of code are “blocking” the progress of other asynchronous events. This means that when an asynchronous event occurs (like a mouse click, a timer firing, or an XMLHttpRequest completing) it gets queued up to be executed later.\r\n\r\nsetTimeout and setInterval are the only native functions of the JavaScript to execute code asynchronously. However, if you are familiar with JavaScript, you have probably dealt with asynchronous execution in various forms. It can happen in multiple situations (non-exhaustive list):\r\n\r\nPerforming an HTTP request\r\nAny I/O operation when you are in a NodeJS environment\r\nDealing with a WebSocket (client or server side)\r\n\r\n#### What does asynchronous mean (Is setTimeout asynchronous)\r\n\r\nYES it is.\r\n\r\nsetTimeout(function(){...}, 0) simply queues the code to run once the current call stack is finished executing.\r\n\r\nSo yes, it's asynchronous in that it breaks the synchronous flow, but it's not actually going to execute concurrently/on a separate thread.\r\n\r\nTo further clarify, there's a difference between concurrency/backgrounding and asynchronous-ness. When code is asynchronous that simply means it isn't executed sequentially.\r\n\r\nAgain - From MDN setTimeout(): - \"Code executed by setTimeout() is run in a separate execution context to the function from which it was called\".\r\n\r\n#### But does this mean it executes in parallel to any other code that is currently in process?\r\n\r\nNo, it doesn't. \"Execution context\" doesn't mean \"thread\". setTimeout code has absolutely no parallelism going on inside it. The \"separate execution context\" mentioned in the documentation just means that the this reference will be different than in the function where setTimeout() is called.\r\nA Javascript engine simply processes a queue of events sequentially on a single thread. When the event queue is empty, that thread idles. In a browser, events are added to the queue by user input, page loading, etc. In node.js events can also be HTTP requests or hardware events. And setTimeout() simply adds another kind of event with the additional condition that it should only be added to the queue after a certain time has passed.\r\n\r\n[https://johnresig.com/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/](https://johnresig.com/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/)\r\n"

        "content": "One of Javascript’s strength is the way it handles asynchronous (async) code. Instead of getting blocked, the thread is pushed in an event queue which gets fired after the execution of all the other codes. This means that you can let your code do several things at the same time without stopping or locking your main thread.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nConsole.log( “a” );\r\nsetTimeout(function () {\r\nConsole.log( “c”)\r\n}, 500 );\r\nsetTimeout(function () {\r\nConsole.log( “d” )\r\n},  500);\r\nsetTimeout(function () {\r\nConsole.log( “e” )\r\n},  500);\r\nConsole.log( “b” );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code above will result with the console displaying “a” and “b” first, then after 500 milliseconds, “c”, “d” and “e” will be displayed.\r\n\r\nNote that a timeout will only be executed after all the code in a block has finished executing. If a long-running function is set before the timeout then the function will have to finish executing first before the setTimeout function gets executed.\r\n\r\n#### Basically, async functions like setTimeout and setInterval are pushed into a special queue known as the “event loop”.\r\n\r\n## The Event Loop - Its a first-in-first-out task queue, or FIFO Queue.\r\n\r\nThe event loop is a special queue for callback functions. When an async code is executed, a callback is then pushed into the queue. The Javascript engine will only execute the event loop if the code after the async function has finished executing. This is because, Javascript is single threaded.\r\n\r\n**The event loop is a first-in-first-out type of queue – callbacks are processed in order they were added to the queue.**\r\n\r\n## The Call Stack - Its a LIFO data structure .\r\n\r\nThe event loop (Which on the other hand is FIFO) continuously checks the call stack to see if there’s any function that needs to run.\r\n\r\nWhile doing so, it adds any function call it finds to the call stack and executes each one in order.\r\n\r\nJavaScript has a single call stack in which it keeps track of what function we’re currently executing and what function is to be executed after that. But first — what’s a stack? A stack is an array-like data structure but with some limitations — you can only add items to the back and only remove the last item.

Then if that function calls another function — the other function will be on top of the first one in the call stack. When you get an error in the console you get a long message that shows you the path of execution — this is what the stack looked in that exact moment. But what if we make a request or put a timeout on something? In theory that should freeze the entire browser until it is executed so the call stack can continue? In practice however, you know that this doesn’t happen — because of the Event Table and Event Queue.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://www.hiddenwebgenius.com/guides/understanding-javascripts-asynchronous-code/](https://www.hiddenwebgenius.com/guides/understanding-javascripts-asynchronous-code/)\r\n\r\n[https://hackernoon.com/understanding-js-the-event-loop-959beae3ac40](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-js-the-event-loop-959beae3ac40)\r\n"

It will not be the same as the `this` value for the function that called setTimeout.**\r\n\r\nWhenever you write a function in JavaScript, the JS engine creates what we call function execution context. Also, each time the JS engine begins, it creates a global execution context that holds the global objects — for example, the window object in the browser and the global object in Node.js. Both these contexts are handled in JS using a stack data structure also known as the execution stack.\r\n\r\nSo, when you write something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction a() {\r\n  console.log(\"i am a\")\r\n  b()\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction b() {\r\n  console.log(\"i am b\")\r\n}\r\n\r\na()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe JavaScript engine first creates a global execution context and pushes it into the execution stack. Then it creates a function execution context for the function a(). Since b() is called inside a(), it will create another function execution context for b() and push it into the stack.\r\n\r\nWhen the function b() returns, the engine destroys the context of b(), and when we exit function a(), the context of a() is destroyed. The stack during execution looks like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./setTimeout-execution-stack.png\">\r\n\r\nBut what happens when the browser makes an asynchronous event like an HTTP request? Does the JS engine stock the execution stack and handle the asynchronous event, or wait until the event completes?\r\n\r\n**The JS engine does something different here. On top of the execution stack, the JS engine has a queue data structure, also known as the event queue. The event queue handles asynchronous calls like HTTP or network events coming into the browser.**\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./setTimeout-execution-stack-2.png\">\r\n\r\nThe way the JS engine handles the stuff in the **event queue** is by waiting for the **main execution stack** to become empty. So each time the **main execution stack**becomes empty, the JS engine checks the event queue, pops items off the queue, and handles that event. It is important to note that the JS engine checks the event queue only when the execution stack is empty or the only item in the execution stack is the global execution context.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://blog.logrocket.com/deep-dive-into-react-fiber-internals/](https://blog.logrocket.com/deep-dive-into-react-fiber-internals/)\r\n"

However, it is one of the worst-case sorting algorithms with respect to runtime. The bubble sort algorithm compares every two adjacent items and swaps them if the first one is bigger than the second one. It has this name because the items tend to move up into the correct order, like bubbles rising to the surface.\r\nbubble-sort should not be used for larger arrays, can be used for smaller ones for its simplicity.\r\n\r\n![Algorithm Visualization](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Bubble-sort-example-300px.gif)\r\n\r\n## Complexity\r\n\r\n| Name                  | Best            | Average             | Worst               | Memory    | Stable    | Comments  |\r\n| --------------------- | :-------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------- |\r\n| **Bubble sort**       | n               | n<sup>2</sup>       | n<sup>2</sup>       | 1         | Yes       |           |\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario of this algorithm is quadratic — O(n²) — because it’s possible that the data will be the exact opposite of ordered. Best case scenario is linear — O(n) — because even if it’s entirely ordered, we have to check through each set of numbers.\r\n\r\n## MOST IMPORTANT POINT OF BUBBLE SORT (And base of my solution SOLUTION-3 ) :-\r\n\r\nA> After the whole first pass is done, (i.e. after the first for loop for i = 0 is run , which also means, for each of i = 0 all the values of the nested for loop for j = 0 to j = arr.length - 1 is run) - The\r\n\r\nSee this for pictorial representation - http://codingmiles.com/sorting-algorithms-bubble-sort-using-javascript/\r\n\r\nSo basically, the bubble sort algorithm can be easily optimized by observing that the n-th pass finds the n-th largest element and puts it into its final place. So, the inner loop can avoid looking at the last n − 1 items when running for the n-th time:\r\n\r\nB> In other words, after the first pass, the biggest elements is placed at its correct position.\r\n\r\nC) And this IS THE PRINCIPLE BASED ON WHICH I CAN IMPROVE THE ALGO BY REDUCING THE NO OF PASSES FOR THE INNER NESTED FOR LOOP EACH TIME - Meaning, for the second loop of i = 1 pass, I actually no more have to compare the right-most element. As I know the right-most element is the biggest and has been placed at its correct right-most position.\r\n\r\nD) Then for for the next loop i=2, I can reduce the no of comarison for the nested for loop by 2, because I know, that the biggest 2 element has already been placed to the farthest right side.\r\n"

                "content": "# Quick Sort\r\n\r\nThe quicksort algorithm basically works by partitioning the entire array, and then recursively partitioning the left and right parts of the array until the entire array is sorted. The left and right parts of the array are determined by the index returns after each partition operation. That index effectively becomes the boundary between the left and right parts of the array.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm for Quicksort is:\r\n\r\n1. Pick a pivot element that divides the list into two sublists.\r\n\r\n2. Start a pointer, to reorder the list so that all elements less than the pivot element are placed before the pivot and all elements greater than the pivot are placed after it.\r\n\r\nSo, e.g. if I choose the pivot to be at 0-index element, I can start that pointer from index-1 element array. However,  under this algorithm (selecting the first item as a pivot), I would get worst-case performance on already sorted arrays.\r\n\r\n3. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called the partition operation.\r\n\r\n4. Repeat steps 1 and 2 on both the list with smaller elements and the list of larger\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n5. Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm in the style of merge sort. The basic idea is to find a “pivot” item in the array to compare all other items against, then shift items such that all of the items before the pivot are less than the pivot value and all the items after the pivot are greater than the pivot value. After that, recursively perform the same operation on the items before and after the pivot.\r\n\r\nAnimated visualization of the quicksort algorithm.\r\nThe horizontal lines are pivot values.\r\n\r\n![Quicksort](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Quicksort.gif)\r\n\r\n## Complexity\r\n\r\n| Name                  | Best            | Average             | Worst               | Memory    | Stable    | Comments  |\r\n| --------------------- | :-------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------- |\r\n| **Quick sort**        | n&nbsp;log(n)   | n&nbsp;log(n)       | n<sup>2</sup>       | log(n)    | No        |           |\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor arrays that are nearly or completely sorted, quicksort operates at its worst. In other words, the average runtime for a sorted or a nearly-sorted list is quicksort’s worst case runtime: **O(n²)**.\r\nThis is particularly important to remember if we know that we’ll be dealing with data that’s mostly sorted. In those situations, we want to stay away from quicksort, since it’s going to take a really long time to run.\r\n\r\nNode, for example, uses quicksort under the hood of its Array.sort function; however, for shorter arrays (in node’s case, those with a length less than or equal to 10), it uses insertion sort! You can see the logic they use to determine that deep within [v8’s source code](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/src/js/array.js#L695).\r\n\r\n\r\n### My Personal Blog Post on Quick Sort - [https://rohan-paul.github.io/javascript/2018/01/11/Quick-Sort_Algorithm-in-JavaScript/](https://rohan-paul.github.io/javascript/2018/01/11/Quick-Sort_Algorithm-in-JavaScript/)"

It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. The helper function merge2SortedArrays() is used for merging two halves. The merge(arr, l, m, r) is key process that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one. See following pseudo-code.\r\n\r\nMergeSort(arr[], l,  r)\r\nIf r > l\r\n     1. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:\r\n             middle m = (l+r)/2\r\n     2. Call mergeSort for first half:\r\n             Call mergeSort(arr, l, m)\r\n     3. Call mergeSort for second half:\r\n             Call mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)\r\n     4. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:\r\n             Call merge(arr, l, m, r)\r\n\r\nANOTHER GOOD EXPLANATION - https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/merge-sort/tutorial/\r\n\r\nIn other words - Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on the idea of breaking down a list into several sub-lists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.\r\n\r\nSteps implemented below :-\r\nA> The array is recursively divided in two halves till the size becomes 1.\r\n\r\nB> Once the size becomes 1, the merge processes comes into action, meaning I invoke the merge function on the 2 single-element arrays. That is, take adjacent pairs of two singleton lists, sort the elements of the 2 list, and merge them to form a list (ie array) of 2 elements .\r\n\r\nC> So the merge2SortedArrays() function below is a completely independent function and will just take 2 sorted-arrays ( the individual arrays MUST BE SORTED ),  and then concat the elements to forma a single SORTED array. That is, within the merge() function before pushing the elements to the final result array (which will be the output from merge ) it checks for proper-sorting between the 2 elements on the 2 arrays.\r\n\r\nmerge( [1, 3, 5, 7 ] , [ 2, 4, 6, 8] ) >>  will produce the below\r\n\r\n[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]\r\n\r\nD) And then starts merging arrays back till the complete array is merged.\r\n*/\r\n\r\nmerge2SortedArrays = (leftSorted, rightSorted) => {\r\n\r\n    let leftIndex = 0, rightIndex = 0, mergedArray = [];\r\n\r\n    while (leftIndex < leftSorted.length && rightIndex < rightSorted.length ) {\r\n        mergedArray.push(\r\n                leftSorted[leftIndex] < rightSorted[rightIndex]\r\n                ? leftSorted[leftIndex++]\r\n                : rightSorted[rightIndex++]\r\n            )\r\n      // Note, I am using post-increment syntax leftIndex++ . So the way it will work is, it will push the current leftIndex and only then it will increment it and pass that incremented value for the next iteration.\r\n}\r\n\r\n    // And now I have to concat the left-over elements of the longer array.

            "content": "In Git, there are two main ways to integrate changes from one branch into another: the merge and the rebase.\r\n\r\n#### Rebasing is often used as an alternative to merging. Rebasing a branch updates one branch with another by applying the commits of one branch on top of the commits of another branch. For example, if working on a `feature` branch that is out of date with a `dev` branch, rebasing the `feature` branch onto `dev` will allow all the new commits from `dev` to be included in `feature`.\r\n\r\nGit’s rebase command reapplies your changes onto another branch. As opposed to merging, which pulls the differences from the other branch into yours, rebasing switches your branch’s base to the other branch’s position and walks through your commits one by one to apply them again.\r\n\r\nFirst checkout a branch and then run the rebase command with the name of the branch you wish to rebase on to:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit checkout feature\r\ngit rebase dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n**In most regular day-to-day cases (i.e. when I am rebasing on top of master), the commands will be**\r\n\r\n`git checkout dev`\r\n`git rebase master`\r\n\r\nAs most of the cases on a regular day, I would have to rebase on top of master branch.\r\n\r\n#### And then after rebasing, if you DON'T get any conflict, and `git status` shows `nothing to commit, working tree clean` - then just do a forced push of your branch\r\n\r\n`git push origin dev --force`\r\n\r\n**Let’s look at an example. While working on a branch named login, based on the master branch, one of your team members pushed some changes to master. You need these changes to finish the login feature in your branch.**\r\n\r\n**Merging the master branch back into yours would result in a merge commit, which includes the changes between both branches and exists to show where a merge occurred. We won’t need to know when we merged the master into the login branch in the future. Instead, we’d like to pretend that all commits on the login branch happened based on the new state of the master branch.**\r\n\r\n<img src=\"git-rebase.png\">\r\n\r\n**Git’s rebase command temporarily rewinds the commits on your current branch, pulls in the commits from the other branch and reapplies the rewinded commits back on top. By switching the current, this bases the current branch onto the other branch.**\r\n\r\n### `$ git rebase master`\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...\r\nFast-forwarded login to master.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**It’s as if you didn’t start working in the login branch before the commits you pulled in were made. You can also pull with rebase so you don’t have to switch out of your current branch.**\r\n\r\n## [More Explanation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)\r\n\r\nHow the `git merge` works - It performs a three-way merge between the two latest branch snapshots (C3 and C4) and the most recent common ancestor of the two (C2), creating a new snapshot (and commit).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"git-merge.png\">\r\n\r\nHowever in `git rebase` you can take the patch of the change that was introduced in C4 and reapply it on top of C3. In Git, this is called rebasing. With the rebase command, you can take all the changes that were committed on one branch and replay them on another one.\r\n\r\n#### For this example, you would check out the experiment branch, and then rebase it onto the master branch as follows:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$ git checkout experiment\r\n$ git rebase master\r\nFirst, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...\r\nApplying: added staged command\r\n```\r\n\r\n### It works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches (the one you’re on and the one you’re rebasing onto), getting the diff introduced by each commit of the branch you’re on, saving those diffs to temporary files, resetting the current branch to the same commit as the branch you are rebasing onto, and finally applying each change in turn.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"git-rebase-2.png\">\r\n\r\nAt this point, you can go back to the master branch and do a fast-forward merge.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$ git checkout master\r\n$ git merge experiment\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img src=\"git-rebase-2.png\">\r\n\r\n## rebase vs merge - how they are different\r\n\r\n#### Now, the snapshot pointed to by C4' is exactly the same as the one that was pointed to by C5 in the merge example. There is no difference in the end product of the integration, but rebasing makes for a cleaner history. If you examine the log of a rebased branch, it looks like a linear history: it appears that all the work happened in series, even when it originally happened in parallel.\r\n\r\nOften, you’ll do this to make sure your commits apply cleanly on a remote branch — perhaps in a project to which you’re trying to contribute but that you don’t maintain. In this case, you’d do your work in a branch and then rebase your work onto origin/master when you were ready to submit your patches to the main project. That way, the maintainer doesn’t have to do any integration work — just a fast-forward or a clean apply.\r\n\r\n#### Note that the snapshot pointed to by the final commit you end up with, whether it’s the last of the rebased commits for a rebase or the final merge commit after a merge, is the same snapshot – it’s only the history that is different. Rebasing replays changes from one line of work onto another in the order they were introduced, whereas merging takes the endpoints and merges them together.\r\n\r\nRebasing a branch in Git is a way to move the entirety of a branch to another point in the tree. The simplest example is moving a branch further up in the tree. Say we have a branch that diverged from the master branch at point A:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./git-rebase-4.png>\">\r\n\r\nUse `git rebase --abort` to completely cancel a rebase, and other useful commands to abort or to continue\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit rebase --continue | --skip | --abort | --edit-todo\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Resources\r\n\r\n[https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/git-rebase/](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/git-rebase/)\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/osedea/git-rebase-powerful-command-507bbac4a234](https://medium.com/osedea/git-rebase-powerful-command-507bbac4a234)\r\n\r\n[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)\r\n\r\n[https://blog.algolia.com/master-git-rebase/](https://blog.algolia.com/master-git-rebase/)\r\n"

Never ever rewrite the history on a publicly accessible repository or a lot of people will hate you.\r\n\r\nThe main thing to keep in mind here is what pull and rebase are doing behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nA pull will basically do two things: fetch and merge. When you include --rebase it will do a rebase instead of the merge.\r\n\r\nA rebase is pretty much like stashing all of your local changes since you branched, fast forwarding your branch to the latest commit on the target, and unstashing your changes in order on top.\r\n\r\nSo, whenever you do a rebase you would need to do a force push **because the remote branch cannot be fast-forwarded to your commit.** You'd always want to make sure that you do a pull before pushing\r\n"

            "content": "### What’s the difference between git fetch and git pull?\r\n\r\nBefore we talk about the differences between these two commands, lets stress their similarities: both are used to download new data from a remote repository.\r\n\r\n**git fetch** really only downloads new data from a remote repository — but it doesn’t integrate any of this new data into your working files. It fetches all of the branches from the repository. This also downloads all of the required commits and files from the other repository.\r\n\r\n`git pull origin master`\r\n\r\n**git fetch** doesn’t integrate any of this new data into your working files. Fetch is great for getting a fresh view on all the things that happened in a remote repository. Due to its “harmless” nature, fetch will never destroy or manipulate anything in your local machine.\r\n\r\n**git pull**, in contrast, is used with a different goal in mind: to update our current HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server. This means that pull not only downloads new data; it also directly integrates it into our current working copy files. This has a couple of consequences:\r\n\r\nSince **git pull** tries to merge remote changes with your local ones, a so-called “merge conflict” can occur. Check out our in-depth tutorial on How to deal with merge conflicts for more information.\r\n\r\nLike for many other actions, it’s highly recommended to start a **git pull** only with a clean working copy. This means that you should not have any uncommitted local changes before you pull. Use Git’s Stash feature to save your local changes temporarily.\r\n\r\nSo when you are working on Forked Repo, after fetching from the remote branch, you would still have to merge the commits. So you can actually replace\r\n\r\n`$ git fetch upstream`\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n`$ git pull upstream master`\r\n\r\nsince git pull is essentially git fetch + git merge.\r\n"

So when something unexpected happens, you can rollback to specific commits.\r\nBut, too many commits may mess your git history. If you have a lot of fixup commits, and you merge all of them directly into master, the git history will be bloated (which is something we don't want). So, if your change consists of two commits X and Y, we want to squash them into a single commit Z\r\n\r\nSome folks do it by hastily creating a new branch, porting all changes to it with a patch file and creating a separate pull request. But this is headache both for the contributor and project maintainer. There's an easier way, which is git squash\r\n\r\n[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-rebase-and-update-a-pull-request](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-rebase-and-update-a-pull-request)\r\n\r\nSo before we start the process of squashing, first find out the number of commits we have made, we can inspect the total number of commits that have been made to the project with the following command:\r\n\r\n`git log`\r\n\r\nThis will provide you with output that looks similar to this\r\n\r\n```js\r\nOutput\r\ncommit 46f196203a16b448bf86e0473246eda1d46d1273\r\nAuthor: username-2 <email-2>\r\nDate: Mon Dec 14 07:32:45 2015 -0400\r\n\r\n    Commit details\r\n\r\ncommit 66e506853b0366c87f4834bb6b39d941cd034fe3\r\nAuthor: username1 <email-1>\r\nDate: Fri Nov 27 20:24:45 2015 -0500\r\n\r\nCommit details\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe log shows all the commits made to the given project’s repository, so your commits will be mixed it with the commits made by others. For projects that have an extensive history of commits by multiple authors, you’ll want to specify yourself as author in the command:\r\n\r\n`git log --author=your-username`\r\n\r\nNow if you know the number of commits you’ve made on the branch (just count it) that you want to rebase, you can simply run the git rebase command like so:\r\n\r\n`git rebase -i HEAD~x`\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n`git rebase -i HEAD~8`\r\n\r\nIf, however, you don’t know how many commits you have made on your branch, you’ll need to find which commit is the base of your branch, which you can do by running the following command:\r\n\r\n`git merge-base new-branch master`\r\n\r\nThis command will return a long string known as a commit hash, something that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOutput\r\n66e506853b0366c87f4834bb6b39d341cd094fe9\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe’ll use this commit hash to pass to the git rebase command:\r\n\r\n`git rebase -i 66e506853b0366c87f4834bb6b39d341cd094fe9`\r\n\r\nFor either of the above commands, your command-line text editor will open with a file that contains a list of all the commits in your branch, and you can now choose whether to squash commits or reword them.\r\n\r\n### Now after running `git rebase -i HEAD~8` the follwoing editor will open in the Terminal and this is where I have to choose which commit to Squash and which ones to Pick\r\n\r\nWhen we squash commit messages, we are squashing or combining several smaller commits into one larger one.\r\n\r\nIn front of each commit you’ll see the word “pick,” so your file will look similar to this if you have two commits:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGNU nano 2.0.6 File: …username/repository/.git/rebase-merge/git-rebase-todo\r\npick a1f29a6 Adding a new feature\r\npick 79c0e80 Here is another new feature\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rebase 66e5068..79c0e80 onto 66e5068 (2 command(s))\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Now, for each line of the file you should replace the word “pick” with the word “squash” to combine the commits: And these lines will be arranged top to bottom like so, the most recent one (i.e. most recent commit) at the bottom most positon. And if I want to keep the lastest commit msg, all I have to do is edit the top-most line as pick and rest of all as squash.\r\n\r\n```\r\nGNU nano 2.0.6 File: …username/repository/.git/rebase-merge/git-rebase-todo\r\npick a1f29a6 Adding a new feature\r\nsquash 79c0e80 Here is another new feature\r\n```\r\n\r\n**At this point, you can save and close the file ( Choosing the option shown in the Terminal, Control + O for writing out, then just press Enter for choosing the default file to write to and then finally Control+X to exit). After first exit, it will open the section editor inside Terminal where I should be able to edit and add the comments for my commit. So the same flow here as well. Edit inside Terminal Editor > press Control+O to write out > Press Enter to save to default file > Control+X to Exit**\r\n\r\n### ISSUE - If I get Error - Git: “Cannot 'squash' without a previous commit” error while rebase\r\n\r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/a/51516360/1902852](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51516360/1902852)\r\n\r\nWhy it happened in my case was that, you cannot squash older commits onto a new commit. Here is an example say you have 3 commits:\r\n\r\n```\r\npick 01mn9h78 The lastest commit\r\npick a2b6pcfr A commit before the latest\r\npick 093479uf An old commit i made a while back\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow if you say git rebase -i HEAD~3 and you do something like\r\n\r\n```\r\npick 01mn9h78 The lastest commit\r\ns a2b6pcfr A commit before the latest\r\ns 093479uf An old commit i made a while back\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will result in the error :\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: cannot 'squash' without a previous commit You can fix this with 'git rebase --edit-todo' and then run 'git rebase --continue'. Or you can abort the rebase with 'git rebase --abort'.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Solution :**\r\n\r\n#### When squashing commits , you should squash recent commits to old ones not vice versa thus in the example it will be something like this :\r\n\r\n### So put the 'squash' or 's' word before the latest comment and 'pick' word before the oldest one\r\n\r\n```\r\ns 01mn9h78 The lastest commit\r\ns a2b6pcfr A commit before the latest\r\npick 093479uf An old commit i made a while back\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Now the FINAL step of actually pushing or updating the PR\r\n\r\n**Once you perform a rebase, the history of your branch changes, and you are no longer able to use the git push command because the direct path has been modified.**\r\n\r\nAnd you can check that by doing a `git status` You will get\r\n\r\n```\r\nYour branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,\r\nand have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively.\r\n  (use \"git pull\" to merge the remote branch into yours)\r\n\r\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will have to instead use the --force or -f flag to force-push the changes, informing Git that you are fully aware of what you are pushing.\r\n\r\nAt this point, we should ensure that we are on the correct branch by checking out the branch we are working on:\r\n\r\n`git checkout new-branch`\r\n\r\n```\r\nOutput\r\nAlready on 'new-branch'\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can perform the force-push:\r\n\r\n`git push -f`\r\n\r\nI could also do below, assuming I am in master branch, and all my squashing activities were in master branch\r\n\r\n`git push origin master --force`\r\n\r\nAnd now if I go to the exiting PR in Github, I will see the same PR has got fully updated with my latest changes, with just a single commit.\r\n\r\nNote, all these squashing activities could have been done by the Repo's Manager as well. The repository's manager can squash all the commits in a pull request into a single commit by selecting \"Squash and merge\" on a pull request.\r\n\r\n#### ISSUE - How to squash commits after the pull request has been opened ? That is, after I have created a PR, then squash my commits in my local machine and then when I go to the PR of the upstream Repo, I still see all the committs that were there previously.\r\n\r\n#### Solution - (the below will save you many times)\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to squash all of these changes is probably start by resetting your current branch back to the upstream master branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git reset upstream/master\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### The magical thing abuout the above command is, this will reset the repository, but not your working directory, to the state of the upstream/master branch. Since it doesn't modify the state of your working directory, this means that all your changes are preserved, but not the commit history. At this point, we see:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\$ git status\r\n[...]\r\nChanges not staged for commit:\r\n(use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\r\n(use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\r\n\r\n    modified:   app/server.go\r\n    modified:   smtp.go\r\n\r\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can create a new commit:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git add -u\r\n$ git commit\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Now you have a single commit on top of the upstream master branch. You would then force push this to your own master branch, which would update the PR.\r\n\r\n(NB: if you're worried about screwing something up or losing your changes or anything like that, either work on a new branch, or just make a local copy of your working directory and work on that instead.)\r\n"

And then do normal\r\n\r\n## \\$ git clone <repo .git >\r\n\r\nNow from the git cloned project’s root directory, create a new branch on which I shall work locally\r\n\r\n## \\$ git checkout -b <new_topic-branch-name>\r\n\r\nSo, as an actual example on 5-March-2018 I ran\r\n\r\n## \\$ git checkout -b storybook-react-UI-component-too\r\n\r\nYou should also make sure that your branch name is a descriptive one. Rather than calling it my-branch, you should go with frontend-hook-migration or fix-documentation-typos instead.\r\n\r\nTerminal will say - `‘Switched to a new branch 'new_topic-branch-name'`\r\n\r\nWork in the local machine for my modification. Once you have modified existing files or added new files to the project, you can add them to your local repository\r\n\r\n## git add -A\r\n\r\n## git commit -m \"adding storybook, a development environment for UI components\"\r\n\r\nTerminal will say something like below\r\n\r\n[storybook-react-UI-component-too 6fcf716] adding storybook, a development environment for UI components\r\n1 file chang\r\n\r\n## git status\r\n\r\nIt may say something on the line -\r\n\r\nOn branch storybook-react-UI-component-too\r\nnothing to commit, working directory clean\r\n\r\n## git push origin storybook-react-UI-component-too\r\n\r\ni.e. the format is -\r\n\r\n## git push origin <new_topic-branch-name-which-I-created-above-and-with-which-I-worked-above>\r\n\r\nF) Then in the browser navigate to the original URL of the Original repo.\r\n\r\nAt the very landing page of the repo I will see my own commits. And click on `“Compare & pull r­equest”` .. Actually that option will be only one, where I can do something, after submitting that commit.\r\n\r\nG) Then in the next page, just put any comments that I may like to put, and , click on “Create Pull Request”.\r\n\r\nThats it..\r\n\r\n### Create Pull Request in a Project - When I am one of the contributor as set by the Master Owner - Updated on 5-Mar-2018\r\n\r\n### \\$ git clone repo.git\r\n\r\n### What to do when there’s a conflict as seen by the master branch owner after I (as a contributor) send the PR - Updated on 5June2018\r\n\r\nMerge request official doc - https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/\r\n\r\n“Merge conflicts may occur if competing changes are made to the same line of a file or when a file is deleted that another person is attempting to edit.”\r\n\r\nFrom official doc - https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github/\r\n\r\nA> Under your repository name, click Pull requests.\r\n\r\nB> In the \"Pull Requests\" list, click the pull request with a merge conflict that you'd like to resolve.\r\n\r\nC> Resolve merge conflicts button.

The target (to which branch the data should be integrated into) is always the currently checked out HEAD branch.\r\nThe source (from which branch the data should be downloaded from) can be specified in the command’s options.\r\n\r\n**Before using “git pull”, make sure the correct local branch is checked out. Then, to perform the pull, simply specify which remote branch you want to integrate. Assuming I am in ‘master’ branch in my local machine, and I want to incorporate changes from a remote repository’s ‘dev’ branch into the local machine’s branch.**\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit checkout dev\r\ngit pull origin dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe branch-name option can be omitted, however, if a tracking relationship with a remote branch is set up. In most cases, however, your local branch will already have a proper tracking connection with a remote branch set up. This configuration provides default values so that the pull command already knows where to pull from without any additional options:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit pull\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt’s often clearer to separate the two actions git pull does. The first thing it does is update the local tracking branch that corresponds to the remote branch. This can be done with git fetch.\r\nThe second is that it then merges in changes, so in its default mode, git pull is shorthand for git fetch followed by git merge FETCH_HEAD.\r\n\r\nMore precisely, git pull runs git fetch with the given parameters and calls git merge to merge the retrieved branch heads into the current branch. With — rebase, it runs git rebase instead of git merge.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do I force “git pull” to overwrite local files?\r\n\r\nImportant: If you have any local changes, they will be lost.

The --hard option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in origin/master.\r\n\r\n#### Another option is git stash\r\n\r\nUncommitted changes, however (even staged), will be lost. Make sure to stash and commit anything you need.\r\n\r\nFor that you can run the following:\r\n\r\n`git stash`\r\n\r\nAnd then to reapply these uncommitted changes:\r\n\r\n`git stash pop`"

        "content": "## Staging Area - Explanation-1\r\n### Most basic explanation of staging concept is that I can only push those files to the remote repo which has been staged. And the way a file is staged is when I do ``git add fileName``\r\n\r\n## Use case - Say I only want to push the changes in file named ``../Git-and-Github/git-staging-area.md``\r\n\r\n### 1> So from project root of this project I do\r\n\r\n``git add Git-and-Github/git-staging-area.md``\r\n\r\n### 2> Then only that file will be staged and NO OTHER FILE\r\n\r\n### 3> Then I run the regular commands of git pushing\r\n\r\n``git commit -m 'some message'``\r\n\r\n``git push``\r\n\r\nAnd I can check in the remote repo, my other modified files have not been pushed from the local machine to remote repo.\r\n\r\nWith most other version control systems, there’s 2 places to store data: your working copy (the folders/files that you’re currently using) and the datastore (where the version control decides how to pack and store your changes). In Git there’s a third option: the staging area (or index). It’s basically a loading dock where you get to determine what changes get shipped away.\r\n\r\nIf we do ``git add .``, that will add everything that has been changed or any new files that have not been tracked yet. The add command doesn’t store the data yet, it simply places it on the loading dock, ready for the next git commit truck to ship it away.\r\n\r\n## Staging Area - More Explanation\r\n\r\nTo stage a file is simply to prepare it finely for a commit. Git, with its index allows you to commit only certain parts of the changes you've done since the last commit. Say you're working on two features - one is finished, and one still needs some work done. You'd like to make a commit and go home (5 o'clock, finally!) but wouldn't like to commit the parts of the second feature, which is not done yet. You stage the parts you know belong to the first feature, and commit. Now your commit is your project with the first feature done, while the second is still in work-in-progress in your working directory.\r\n\r\nSo the staging area is like a cache of files that you want to commit\r\n\r\n## Staging Area - Even More Explanation\r\n\r\n[https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/119782/what-does-stage-mean-in-git](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/119782/what-does-stage-mean-in-git)\r\n\r\nStaging is a step before the commit process in git. That is, a commit in git is performed in two steps: staging and actual commit.\r\n\r\nAs long as a changeset is in the staging area, git allows you to edit it as you like (replace staged files with other versions of staged files, remove changes from staging, etc.).\r\n\r\nConsider a scenario where you call the movers to get your stuff from your old appartment to your new appartment. Before you do that, you will go through your stuff, decide what you take with you and what you throw away, pack it in bags and leave it in the main hallway. The movers simply come, get the (already packed) bags from the hallway and transport them. In this example, everything until the movers get your stuff, is staging: you decide what goes where, how to pack it and so on (e.g. you may decide that half your stuff will be thrown away before the movers even get there - that's part of staging).\r\n\r\nFrom a technical point of view, staging also supports transactional commits, by splitting all operations into what can fail (staging) and what cannot fail (commit):\r\n\r\nThe commit in git is implemented transactionally, after the staging is sucessfull. Several steps in the staging can fail (for example, you need to commit, but your HDD is 99.9999% full, and git has no space to perform a commit). This will fail in staging (your repository will not be corrupted by a partial commit) and the staging process doesn't affect your commit history (it doesn't corrupt your repository in case of an error)."

        "content": "## git stash - How to Save Your Changes Temporarily\r\n\r\n[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing)\r\n\r\nOften, when you’ve been working on part of your project, things are in a messy state and you want to switch branches for a bit to work on something else. The problem is, you don’t want to do a commit of half-done work just so you can get back to this point later. The answer to this issue is the git stash command.\r\n\r\nStashing takes the dirty state of your working directory — that is, your modified tracked files and staged changes — and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.\r\n\r\nStashing Your Work\r\nTo demonstrate, you’ll go into your project and start working on a couple of files and possibly stage one of the changes. If you run git status, you can see your dirty state:\r\n\r\n## $ git status\r\n\r\n```\r\n# On branch master\r\n# Changes to be committed:\r\n#   (use \"git reset HEAD <file>...\" to unstage)\r\n#\r\n#      modified:   index.html\r\n#\r\n# Changes not staged for commit:\r\n#   (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\r\n#\r\n#      modified:   lib/simplegit.rb\r\n#\r\n```\r\nNow you want to switch branches, but you don’t want to commit what you’ve been working on yet; so you’ll stash the changes. To push a new stash onto your stack, run git stash:\r\n\r\n## $ git stash\r\n\r\n```\r\nSaved working directory and index state \\\r\n  \"WIP on master: 049d078 added the index file\"\r\nHEAD is now at 049d078 added the index file\r\n(To restore them type \"git stash apply\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Look Your working directory is clean, just as it would have been if I had committed the changes\r\n\r\n## $ git status\r\n\r\n```\r\n# On branch master\r\nnothing to commit, working directory clean\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point, you can easily switch branches and do work elsewhere; your changes are stored on your stack. To see which stashes you’ve stored, you can use git stash list:\r\n\r\n## $ git stash list\r\n\r\n```\r\nstash@{0}: WIP on master: 049d078 added the index file\r\nstash@{1}: WIP on master: c264051 Revert \"added file_size\"\r\nstash@{2}: WIP on master: 21d80a5 added number to log\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, two stashes were done previously, so you have access to three different stashed works. You can reapply the one you just stashed by using the command shown in the help output of the original stash command: git stash apply. If you want to apply one of the older stashes, you can specify it by naming it, like this: git stash apply stash@{2}. If you don’t specify a stash, Git assumes the most recent stash and tries to apply it:\r\n\r\n## Continuing Where You Left Off\r\n\r\nGit's Stash is meant as a temporary storage. When you're ready to continue where you left off, you can restore the saved state easily:\r\n\r\n## $ git stash apply\r\n\r\nThis command takes the top most stash in the stack and applies it to the repo. In our case it is stash@{0}\r\n\r\nIf you want to apply some other stash you can specify the stash id.\r\n\r\nHere’s the example:\r\n\r\ngit stash apply stash@{1}\r\n\r\n```\r\n# On branch master\r\n# Changes not staged for commit:\r\n#   (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\r\n#\r\n#      modified:   index.html\r\n#      modified:   lib/simplegit.rb\r\n#\r\n```\r\nYou can see that Git re-modifies the files you uncommitted when you saved the stash. In this case, you had a clean working directory when you tried to apply the stash, and you tried to apply it on the same branch you saved it from; but having a clean working directory and applying it on the same branch aren’t necessary to successfully apply a stash. You can save a stash on one branch, switch to another branch later, and try to reapply the changes. You can also have modified and uncommitted files in your working directory when you apply a stash — Git gives you merge conflicts if anything no longer applies cleanly.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Here are some more useful trick about Git stash\r\n\r\n## git stash pop\r\n\r\nThis command is very similar to stash apply but it deletes the topmost stash from the stack after it is applied.\r\n\r\nSo, this **pop** is just like the JS's Array.pop() method - It returns the removed element from the array and mutates the original array. The \"pop\" flag will reapply the last saved state and, at the same time, delete its representation on the Stash (in other words: it does the clean-up for you).\r\n\r\nLikewise, if you want a particular stash to pop you can specify the stash id.\r\n\r\n## git stash pop stash@{1}\r\n\r\n## git stash show\r\n\r\nThis command shows the summary of the stash diffs. The above command considers only the latest stash.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to see the full diff, you can use\r\n\r\n## git stash show -p\r\n\r\nLikewise with other commands, you can also specify the stash id to get the diff summary.\r\n\r\n## git stash show stash@{1}\r\n\r\n## Git stash branch <name>\r\n\r\nThis command creates a new branch with the latest stash, and then deletes the latest stash ( like stash pop).\r\n\r\nIf you need a particular stash you can specify the stash id.\r\n\r\n## git stash branch <name> stash@{1}\r\n\r\nThis will be useful when you run into conflicts after you’ve applied the stash to the latest version of your branch.\r\n\r\n## git stash clear\r\n\r\nThis command deletes all the stashes made in the repo. It maybe impossible to revert.\r\n\r\n## git stash drop\r\n\r\nThis command deletes the latest stash from the stack. But use it with caution, it maybe be difficult to revert.\r\n\r\nYou can also specify the stash id.\r\n\r\n## git stash drop stash@{1}\r\n\r\nIf you no longer need a particular stash, you can delete it with:\r\n\r\n## git stash drop <stash_id>\r\n\r\nyou can delete all of your stashes from the repo with\r\n\r\n## $ git stash clear"

Both our local feature / bugfix / “dev” branch and the receiving branch should be updated with the latest changes from our remote server.\r\nThe target of this integration (i.e. the branch that receives changes) is always the currently checked out HEAD branch (in the below case its 'dev' branch). Meaning in below I want to merge the latest pulled-in master branch to my currenty WIP branch named 'dev'. This is the set of commands you will most often do during a regular day, to keep your branch updated with the master branch.\r\n\r\n```js\r\ngit checkout master\r\ngit pull\r\ngit checkout dev\r\ngit merge master\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if you are currently working in a branch named dev and would like to merge any new changes that were made in a branch named new-features, you would issue the following command:\r\n\r\n`git merge new-features`\r\n\r\n### How to resolve Merge Conflicts after doing git merge\r\n\r\nif two people changed the same lines in that same file, or if one person decided to delete it while the other person decided to modify it, Git simply cannot know what is correct. Git will then mark the file as having a conflict — which you’ll have to solve before you can continue your work. And in terminal you will see something like this.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.js\r\nAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\r\n```\r\n\r\nGit hasn’t automatically created a new merge commit. It has paused the process while you resolve the conflict. If you want to see which files are unmerged at any point after a merge conflict, you can run git status:\r\n`git status`\r\n\r\n```\r\nOn branch master\r\nYou have unmerged paths.\r\n(fix conflicts and run \"git commit\")\r\n\r\nUnmerged paths:\r\n(use \"git add <file>...\" to mark resolution)\r\n\r\n    both modified:      index.js\r\n\r\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nTake a look at the contents of the conflicted file. Git was nice enough to mark the problematic area in the file by enclosing it in “<<<<<<< HEAD” and “>>>>>>> [other/branch/name]”.\r\n\r\nThe contents after the first marker originate from our current working branch. After the angle brackets, Git tells us where (from which branch) the changes came from. A line with “=======” separates the two conflicting changes.\r\n\r\nThis means the version in HEAD (our master branch, because that was what I had checked out when I ran the git merge command) is the top part of that block (everything above the =======). This is the receiving branch.\r\nAnd the version in my dev branch looks like everything in the bottom part.\r\n\r\nOur job is now to clean up these lines. In a team its advisable to consult other teammate who wrote the conflicting changes to decide which code is finally correct.\r\n\r\nAt this stage (i.e. after manually resolving all the conflicts) - If I do < git merge > it will give me error as below\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: Merging is not possible because you have unmerged files.\r\nhint: Fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm <file>'\r\nhint: as appropriate to mark resolution and make a commit.\r\nfatal: Exiting because of an unresolved conflict.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because my current branch has changes that has NOT been committed.\r\n\r\nSo when you've successfully solved all conflicts, you need to do two more things:\r\n\r\n-1. So now, you'll have to mark the file as resolved by executing a \"git add <filename>\" command. OR a `git add -A` command.\r\n\r\n-2. AND then, after solving all conflicts, a merge conflict situation needs to be absolutely finally concluded by a regular commit. Just as you would commit any other change with the \"git commit\" command.\r\n\r\n### How to Undo a Merge\r\n\r\nYou should always keep in mind that you can return to the state before you started the merge at any time. This should give you the confidence that you can't break anything. On the command line, a simple \"git merge --abort\" will do this for you.\r\n\r\nIn case you've made a mistake while resolving a conflict and realize this only after completing the merge, you can still easily undo it: just roll back to the commit before the merge happened with \"git reset --hard \" and start over again.\r\n\r\nOverall remember - Fetch Remote Changes Frequently to Avoid Big Conflicts\r\n\r\n##### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[merge-conflicts](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/advanced-topics/merge-conflicts)\r\n"

        "content": "GraphQL is a query language created by Facebook in 2012 which provides a common interface between the client and the server for data fetching and manipulations.\r\n\r\nThe client asks for various data from the GraphQL server via queries. The response format is described in the query and defined by the client instead of the server: they are called client‐specified queries.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the data is not hardcoded as in traditional REST APIs - this makes retrieving data from the server more efficient for the client.\r\n\r\n#### Drawbacks of REST\r\nThe core concept of REST is that everything is a resource. While REST was a great solution when it was first proposed, there are some pretty significant issues that the architecture suffers from right now. Let’s explore some of the most significant limitations of REST today:\r\n\r\n#### 1- Multiple Round Trips To Fetch Related Resources\r\nToday’s web and mobile applications are often data-driven and require large sets of data combining related resources. Accessing those data by using a REST-based API often requires us to do multiple round-trips to collect everything what is needed. E.g. imagine you’d like to request information from a post entity. At the same time you’d like to request information of post author (which is a different entity). Typically this is done by sending two request to the REST API (e.g. by using HTTP GET). First to retrieve the post object and second to retrieve the user object.\r\n\r\nEndpoints for posts and users:\r\n\r\nmydomain.com/posts/:id\r\n\r\nmydomain.com/users/:id\r\n\r\n#### Over Fetching / Under Fetching\r\n\r\nAnother common problem which occurs when using RESTful services is the problem of over / under fetching. So what does that exactly mean? Let’s get back to the previous example. By using endpoint mydomain.com/posts/:id we’re fetching data for a specific post. Each post might comprise the following properties: id, title, user, and body. You’ll always get back the complete set of data. There is no way to limit the response to only contain a subset of data like title and user.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Explain the main difference between REST and GraphQL\r\n\r\nThe main and most important difference between REST and GraphQL is that GraphQL is not dealing with dedicated resources, instead everything is regarded as a graph and therefore is connected and can be queried to app exact needs.\r\n\r\n This means that you can tailor the request (query) to your exact needs by using the GraphQL query language and describing what you would like to get as an answer. You can combine different entities in one query and you are able to specific which attributes should be included in the response on every level, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n     post(id: 1) {\r\n        title\r\n        user {\r\n            name\r\n            email\r\n            courses {\r\n                title\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```"

A DOCTYPE is always associated to a **DTD** - for **Document Type Definition**.\r\n\r\nA DTD defines how documents of a certain type should be structured (i.e. a `button` can contain a `span` but not a `div`), whereas a DOCTYPE declares what DTD a document _supposedly_ respects (i.e. this document respects the HTML DTD).\r\n\r\nFor webpages, the DOCTYPE declaration is required. It is used to tell user agents what version of the HTML specifications your document respects. Once a user agent has recognized a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the **no-quirks mode** matching this DOCTYPE for reading the document. If a user agent doesn't recognize a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the **quirks mode**.\r\n\r\nThe DOCTYPE declaration for the HTML5 standards is `<!DOCTYPE html>`.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#the-doctype\r\n- https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/xhtml.html\r\n- https://quirks.spec.whatwg.org/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?\r\n\r\nI will assume that it is asking about the most common case, which is how to serve a page with content available in multiple languages, but the content within the page should be displayed only in one consistent language.\r\n\r\nWhen an HTTP request is made to a server, the requesting user agent usually sends information about language preferences, such as in the `Accept-Language` header. The server can then use this information to return a version of the document in the appropriate language if such an alternative is available. The returned HTML document should also declare the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag, such as `<html lang=\"en\">...</html>`.\r\n\r\nOf course this is useless for letting a search engine know that the same content is available in different languages, and so you must also make use of the `hreflang` attribute in the `<head>`. Eg. `<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"de\" href=\"http://de.example.com/page.html\" />`\r\n\r\nIn the back end, the HTML markup will contain `i18n` placeholders and content for the specific language stored in YML or JSON formats. The server then dynamically generates the HTML page with content in that particular language, usually with the help of a back end framework.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://www.w3.org/International/getting-started/language\r\n- https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### What kind of things must you be wary of when designing or developing for multilingual sites?\r\n\r\n- Use `lang` attribute in your HTML.\r\n- Directing users to their native language - Allow a user to change his country/language easily without hassle.\r\n- Text in raster-based images (e.g. png, gif, jpg, etc.), is not a scalable approach - Placing text in an image is still a popular way to get good-looking, non-system fonts to display on any computer. However, to translate image text, each string of text will need to have a separate image created for each language.

Be wary of layout or overflow issues in the design. It's best to avoid designing where the amount of text would make or break a design. Character counts come into play with things like headlines, labels, and buttons. They are less of an issue with free-flowing text such as body text or comments.\r\n- Be mindful of how colors are perceived - Colors are perceived differently across languages and cultures. The design should use color appropriately.\r\n- Formatting dates and currencies - Calendar dates are sometimes presented in different ways. Eg. \"May 31, 2012\" in the U.S. vs. \"31 May 2012\" in parts of Europe.\r\n- Do not concatenate translated strings - Do not do anything like `\"The date today is \" + date`. It will break in languages with different word order. Use a template string with parameters substitution for each language instead. For example, look at the following two sentences in English and Chinese respectively: `I will travel on {% date %}` and `{% date %} 我会出发`. Note that the position of the variable is different due to grammar rules of the language.\r\n- Language reading direction - In English, we read from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, in traditional Japanese, text is read up-to-down, right-to-left.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-things-one-should-be-wary-of-when-designing-or-developing-for-multilingual-sites\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### What are `data-` attributes good for?\r\n\r\nBefore JavaScript frameworks became popular, front end developers used `data-` attributes to store extra data within the DOM itself, without other hacks such as non-standard attributes, extra properties on the DOM. It is intended to store custom data private to the page or application, for which there are no more appropriate attributes or elements.\r\n\r\nThese days, using `data-` attributes is generally not encouraged. One reason is that users can modify the data attribute easily by using inspect element in the browser. The data model is better stored within JavaScript itself and stay updated with the DOM via data binding possibly through a library or a framework.\r\n\r\nHowever, one perfectly valid use of data attributes, is to add a hook for _end to end_ testing frameworks such as Selenium and Capybara without having to create a meaningless classes or ID attributes. The element needs a way to be found by a particular Selenium spec and something like `data-selector='the-thing'` is a valid way to do so without convoluting the semantic markup otherwise.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- http://html5doctor.com/html5-custom-data-attributes/\r\n- https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-*-attributes\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Consider HTML5 as an open web platform.

Use `async` when the script is independent of any other scripts on the page, for example, analytics.\r\n- `<script defer>` - The script will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed when the page has finished parsing. If there are multiple of them, each deferred script is executed in the order they were encoun­tered in the document. If a script relies on a fully-parsed DOM, the `defer` attribute will be useful in ensuring that the HTML is fully parsed before executing. There's not much difference in putting a normal `<script>` at the end of `<body>`. A deferred script must not contain `document.write`.\r\n\r\nNote: The `async` and `defer` attrib­utes are ignored for scripts that have no `src` attribute.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/02/async-vs-defer-attributes.html\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10808109/script-tag-async-defer\r\n- https://bitsofco.de/async-vs-defer/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s between `<head></head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?\r\n\r\n**Placing `<link>`s in the `<head>`**\r\n\r\nPutting `<link>`s in the `<head>` is part of proper specification in building an optimized website. When a page first loads, HTML and CSS are being parsed simultaneously; HTML creates the DOM (Document Object Model) and CSS creates the CSSOM (CSS Object Model). Both are needed to create the visuals in a website, allowing for a quick \"first meaningful paint\" timing. This progressive rendering is a category optimization sites are measured in their performance scores. Putting stylesheets near the bottom of the document is what prohibits progressive rendering in many browsers. Some browsers block rendering to avoid having to repaint elements of the page if their styles change. The user is then stuck viewing a blank white page. Other times there can be flashes of unstyled content (FOUC), which show a webpage with no styling applied.\r\n\r\n**Placing `<script>`s just before `</body>`**\r\n\r\n`<script>` tags block HTML parsing while they are being downloaded and executed which can slow down your page. Placing the scripts at the bottom will allow the HTML to be parsed and displayed to the user first.\r\n\r\nAn exception for positioning of `<script>`s at the bottom is when your script contains `document.write()`, but these days it's not a good practice to use `document.write()`. Also, placing `<script>`s at the bottom means that the browser cannot start downloading the scripts until the entire document is parsed. This ensures your code that needs to manipulate DOM elements will not throw and error and halt the entire script. If you need to put `<script>` in the `<head>`, use the `defer` attribute, which will achieve the same effect of downloading and running the script only after the HTML is parsed.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that putting scripts just before the closing `</body>` tag will create the illusion that the page loads faster on an empty cache (since the scripts won't block downloading the rest of the document). However, if you have some code you want to run during page load, it will only start executing after the entire page has loaded. If you put those scripts in the `<head>` tag, they would start executing before - so on a primed cache the page would actually appear to load faster.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#css_top\r\n- https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/web-designer/how-to-prevent-flash-of-unstyled-content-on-your-websites/\r\n- https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### What is progressive rendering?\r\n\r\nProgressive rendering is the name given to techniques used to improve the performance of a webpage (in particular, improve perceived load time) to render content for display as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nIt used to be much more prevalent in the days before broadband internet but it is still used in modern development as mobile data connections are becoming increasingly popular (and unreliable)!\r\n\r\nExamples of such techniques:\r\n\r\n- Lazy loading of images - Images on the page are not loaded all at once. JavaScript will be used to load an image when the user scrolls into the part of the page that displays the image.\r\n- Prioritizing visible content (or above-the-fold rendering) - Include only the minimum CSS/content/scripts necessary for the amount of page that would be rendered in the users browser first to display as quickly as possible, you can then use deferred scripts or listen for the `DOMContentLoaded`/`load` event to load in other resources and content.\r\n- Async HTML fragments - Flushing parts of the HTML to the browser as the page is constructed on the back end. More details on the technique can be found [here](http://www.ebaytechblog.com/2014/12/08/async-fragments-rediscovering-progressive-html-rendering-with-marko/).\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33651166/what-is-progressive-rendering\r\n- http://www.ebaytechblog.com/2014/12/08/async-fragments-rediscovering-progressive-html-rendering-with-marko/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Why you would use a `srcset` attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.\r\n\r\nYou would use the `srcset` attribute when you want to serve different images to users depending on their device display width - serve higher quality images to devices with retina display enhances the user experience while serving lower resolution images to low-end devices increase performance and decrease data wastage (because serving a larger image will not have any visible difference). For example: `<img srcset=\"small.jpg 500w, medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 2000w\" src=\"...\" alt=\"\">` tells the browser to display the small, medium or large `.jpg` graphic depending on the client's resolution. The first value is the image name and the second is the width of the image in pixels. For a device width of 320px, the following calculations are made:\r\n\r\n- 500 / 320 = 1.5625\r\n- 1000 / 320 = 3.125\r\n- 2000 / 320 = 6.25\r\n\r\nIf the client's resolution is 1x, 1.5625 is the closest, and `500w` corresponding to `small.jpg` will be selected by the browser.\r\n\r\nIf the resolution is retina (2x), the browser will use the closest resolution above the minimum. Meaning it will not choose the 500w (1.5625) because it is greater than 1 and the image might look bad. The browser would then choose the image with a resulting ratio closer to 2 which is 1000w (3.125).\r\n\r\n`srcset`s solve the problem whereby you want to serve smaller image files to narrow screen devices, as they don't need huge images like desktop displays do — and also optionally that you want to serve different resolution images to high density/low-density screens.\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images\r\n- https://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-youre-just-changing-resolutions-use-srcset/\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Have you used different HTML templating languages before?\r\n\r\nYes, Pug (formerly Jade), ERB, Slim, Handlebars, Jinja, Liquid, and EJS just to name a few. In my opinion, they are more or less the same and provide similar functionality of escaping content and helpful filters for manipulating the data to be displayed. Most templating engines will also allow you to inject your own filters in the event you need custom processing before display.\r\n\r\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)\r\n\r\n### Other Answers\r\n\r\n- https://neal.codes/blog/front-end-interview-questions-html/\r\n- http://peterdoes.it/2015/12/03/a-personal-exercise-front-end-job-interview-questions-and-my-answers-all/"

It is essentially an API to the page, allowing programs to read and manipulate the page’s content, structure, and styles. Let’s break this down.\r\n\r\n### How is a web page built?\r\n\r\nHow a browser goes from a source HTML document to displaying a styled and interactive page in the viewport is called the “Critical Rendering Path”. Although this process can be broken down into several steps, these steps can be roughly grouped into two stages. The first stage involves the browser parsing the document to determine what will ultimately be rendered on the page, and the second stage involves the browser performing the render.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"How-DOM-is-rendered.png\">\r\n\r\nThe result of the first stage is what is called a “render tree”. The render tree is a representation of the HTML elements that will be rendered on the page and their related styles. In order to build this tree, the browser needs two things:\r\n\r\nThe CSSOM, a representation of the styles associated with elements\r\nThe DOM, a representation of the elements\r\n\r\n### How is the DOM created (and what does it look like)?\r\n\r\nThe DOM is an object-based representation of the source HTML document. It has some differences, as we will see below, but it is essentially an attempt to convert the structure and content of the HTML document into an object model that can be used by various programs.\r\n\r\nThe object structure of the DOM is represented by what is called a “node tree”. It is so called because it can be thought of as a tree with a single parent stem that branches out into several child branches, each which may have leaves. In this case, the parent “stem” is the root <html> element, the child “branches” are the nested elements, and the “leaves” are the content within the elements.\r\n\r\nLet’s take this HTML document as an example:\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"HTML-Tree.png\">\r\n\r\n### The DOM is not what you see in the browser (i.e., the render tree)\r\n\r\nWhat you see in the browser viewport is the render tree which, as I mentioned, is a combination of the DOM and the CSSOM. What really separates the DOM from the render tree, is that the latter only consists of what will eventually be painted on the screen.\r\n\r\nBecause the render tree is only concerned with what is rendered, it excludes elements that are visually hidden. For example, elements that have display: none styles associated to them.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"DOMvs-Browser-rendered-tree-in-viewport.png\">\r\n\r\n### The DOM is not what is in DevTools\r\n\r\nThis difference is a bit more minuscule because the DevTools element inspector provides the closest approximation to the DOM that we have in the browser. However, the DevTools inspector includes additional information that isn’t in the DOM.\r\n\r\nThe best example of this is CSS pseudo-elements. Pseudo-elements created using the ::before and ::after selectors form part of the CSSOM and render tree, but are not technically part of the DOM. This is because the DOM is built from the source HTML document alone, not including the styles applied to the element.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that pseudo-elements are not part of the DOM, they are in our devtools element inspector.\r\n\r\n### This is why pseudo-elements cannot be targetted by Javascript, because they are not part of the DOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### More Resources to Read\r\n[https://bitsofco.de/what-exactly-is-the-dom/](https://bitsofco.de/what-exactly-is-the-dom/)\r\n"

So, we specify the encoding to be of multipart/form-data. This tells that no encoding is to be done of any character and all data is to be sent as it is.\r\n\r\nIf you don't use this multipart encoding, the server will fail to process the request and file upload may eventually fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n2> [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4526273/what-does-enctype-multipart-form-data-mean](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4526273/what-does-enctype-multipart-form-data-mean)\r\n\r\nWhen you make a POST request, you have to encode the data that forms the body of the request in some way.\r\n\r\nHTML forms provide three methods of encoding.\r\n\r\n```\r\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded (the default)\r\nmultipart/form-data\r\ntext/plain\r\n```\r\nWork was being done on adding application/json, but that has been abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe specifics of the formats don't matter to most developers. The important points are:\r\n\r\n#### When you are writing client-side code, all you need to know is use multipart/form-data when your form includes any <input type=\"file\"> elements.\r\n\r\nWhen you are writing server-side code: Use a prewritten form handling library (e.g. Perl's CGI->param or the one exposed by PHP's $_POST superglobal) and it will take care of the differences for you. Don't bother trying to parse the raw input received by the server.\r\n\r\nNever use text/plain.\r\n\r\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded is more or less the same as a query string on the end of the URL.\r\n\r\nmultipart/form-data is significantly more complicated but it allows entire files to be included in the data.\r\n\r\ntext/plain is introduced by HTML 5 and is useful only for debugging — from the spec: They are not reliably interpretable by computer — and I'd argue that the others combined with tools (like the Net tab in the developer tools of most browsers) are better for that).\r\n\r\nA quick and basic implemention of the ``enctype``\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<body class=\"bg-primary\">\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-md-6 m-auto\">\r\n                <h1 class=\"text-center display-4 my-4\">Mongo File Uploads</h1>\r\n                <form action=\"/upload\" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"></form>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Good Reference\r\n\r\n1>"

            "content": "### Arrow functions are cool in ES6. When should you NOT use arrow functions. Name three or more cases.\r\n\r\n### 1. Event Handlers\r\n\r\nLet's look at this example, we have a link on our page with an id of `myLink`. Every time you hover over this link, a CSS class `highlight` is toggled and the text is highlighted.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myLink = document.getElementById(\"myLink\")\r\nmyLink.addEventListener(\"mouseenter\", function() {\r\n  this.classList.toggle(\"highlight\")\r\n  console.log(this.classList)\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis logs `highlight`.\r\n\r\nUsing ES6 syntax, this works as expected. Now let's try that in ES6 using arrow functions:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst myLink = document.getElementById(\"myLink\")\r\nmyLink.addEventListener(\"mouseenter\", () => {\r\n  this.classList.toggle(\"hightlight\")\r\n  console.log(this.classList)\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis logs `TypeError: Cannot read property 'classList' of undefined`.\r\n\r\nWhen using an arrow function `this` is not bound to anything and it just inherits it from the parent scope which may be window. If we use a regular function, the keyword 'this' will be bound to the element we clicked. Remember,\r\n\r\n## 2: Object Methods\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst person = {\r\n  points: 23,\r\n  score: () => {\r\n    return this.points++\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\nperson.score()\r\n\r\nconsole.log(person.points) // it outputs 23 irrespective of how many times i run the above block of code instead of getting incremented by earlier call of person.score().\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have our method called score, and whenever we call person.score, it should add one to our points, which is currently 23.\r\n\r\nIf we run person.score(); a few times, we should be at 26 or something.\r\n\r\nBut if I call person.points is still at 23. Why?\r\n\r\nBecause it’s trying to add points to the window! Remember, when using an arrow function this is not bound to anything and it just inherits it from the parent scope which in this case is the window.\r\n\r\nSo let’s do the same thing with a normal function:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconst person = {\r\n    points: 23,\r\n    score: function()  {\r\n        this.points++;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nperson.score();\r\n\r\nconsole.log(person.points)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now, first output is 24 and then 25 and so on..\r\n"

If it is you who calls the function then there is usually no need to use .bind, since you have control over how to call the function, and therefore its this value.\r\n\r\nHowever, often it is not you who calls the function. Functions are passed to other functions as callbacks and event handlers. They are called by other code and you have no control over how the function is called, and therefore cannot control what this will refer to.\r\n\r\nIf your function requires this to be set to a specific value and you are not the one calling the function, you need to .bind the function to a specific this value.\r\n\r\nIn other words: .bind allows you to set the value of this without calling the function now.\r\n\r\nThe bind() function creates a new bound function, which is an exotic function object (a term from ECMAScript 2015) that wraps the original function object. Calling the bound function generally results in the execution of its wrapped function.\r\n\r\n`let boundFunc = func.bind(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...argN]]])`\r\n\r\n**thisArg**\r\n\r\nThe value to be passed as the this parameter to the target function func when the bound function is called.

If you know the number of arguments to be passed or there are no argument to pass you can use call.\r\n\r\n**APPLY()** : Calls a function with argument provided as an array. You can use apply if you don't know how many arguments are going to be passed to the function.\r\n\r\nThere is a advantage of using apply over call, we don't need to change the number of argument only we can change an array that is passed.\r\n\r\nThere is not big difference in performance. But we can say call is bit faster as compare to apply because an array need to evaluate in apply method.\r\n\r\n### Both call() and apply() are methods we can use to assign the this pointer for the duration of a method invocation.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nglobal.x = 10\r\n/* To run this file in my vs-code or in terminal (i.e. where I am in node env),\r\nI have to use global . where as < var x = 10 > will work in browser dev-tool\r\n\r\nvar x = 10 */\r\n\r\nvar o = { x: 15 }\r\n\r\nfunction f() {\r\n  console.log(this.x)\r\n}\r\n\r\nf() // => 10\r\n\r\nf.call(o) // => 15\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Very Importantly note, the call() method as above will NOT work in arrow function. And this.x will produce undefined. Because, Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own 'this'\r\n\r\n```js\r\nglobal.x = 10\r\n\r\nconst obj = {\r\n  x: 15,\r\n  func: () => console.log(this.x),\r\n  func2: function() {\r\n    console.log(this.x)\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst func = () => console.log(this.x)\r\n\r\nfunc() // => undefined\r\nfunc.call(obj) // => undefined\r\nobj.func.call(obj) // => undefined\r\n// But the following will work as expected\r\nobj.func2.call(obj) // => 15, accessing the\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first invocation of f() will display the value of 10, because this references the global object. The second invocation (via the call method) however, will display the value 15. 15 is the value of the x property inside object obj.\r\n\r\n### The call() method invokes the function and uses its first parameter as the this pointer inside the body of the function. In other words - we've told the runtime what object to reference as 'this' while executing inside of function f().\r\n\r\n### The apply() method is identical to call(), except apply() requires an array as the second parameter. The array represents the arguments for the target method.\r\n\r\nA> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1986896/what-is-the-difference-between-call-and-apply?rq=1 – This page has a long answer explaining apply() with example and how correctly assigning value to “this” is so very important when defining method.\r\n\r\n### When calling a function of the form foo.bar.baz(), the object foo.bar is referred to as the receiver. When the function is called, it is the receiver that is used as the value for this. If there is no explicit receiver when a function is called, then the global object becomes the receiver.\r\n\r\n### Because functions are first-class objects in JavaScript, they can have their own methods. All functions have the methods call() and apply() which make it possible to redefine the receiver (i.e., the object that this refers to) when calling the function.\r\n\r\n### The value of this can never be null or undefined when a function is called. When null or undefined is supplied as the receiver to call() or apply(), the global object is used as the value for receiver instead.\r\n\r\nB> The apply function is used to call another function, with a given context and arguments, provided as an array. The min and max functions can take an arbitrary number of input arguments: Math.max(val1, val2, ..., valN)\r\n\r\nSo if we call:\r\n\r\n`Math.min.apply(Math, [1,2,3,4]);`\r\n\r\nThe apply function will execute:\r\n\r\n`Math.min(1,2,3,4);`\r\n\r\nNote that the first parameter, the context, is not important for these functions since they are static, they will work regardless of what is passed as the context.\r\n\r\n### Special note - With ES6, the equivalent code for the above is `Math.max(...Arr)`\r\n\r\nReplacing “Math” with “null” would output same output\r\n"

Bind returns a new function.\r\n\r\nCall and apply are very similar in that they allow you to invoke a function. The difference is that call takes arguments one by one, apply takes in arguments as an array.\r\n\r\n### Remember A for apply, A for array. Consider the following examples.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar john = {\r\n  favoriteFood: 'pizza'\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar bob = {\r\n  favoriteFood: 'spaghetti'\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar favFood = function(eatAction, afterEatAction) {\r\n  console.log('It\\'s time to ' + eatAction + ' ' + this.favoriteFood + '! Then ' + afterEatAction + '.')\r\n}\r\n\r\nbob.favFood('scarf down', 'sleep')\r\n\r\n// bob.favFood is not a function...\r\n// Results in error, favFood is not a method on bob\r\n// In order to user this method for bob, I need to use call or apply\r\n\r\nfavFood.call(bob, 'scarf down', 'sleep') //It's time to scarf down spaghetti! Then sleep.\r\n\r\nfavFood.apply(john, ['scarf down', 'sleep']) //It's time to scarf down pizza! Then sleep.\r\n\r\nfavFood.call(john, ['scarf down', 'sleep']) //It's time to scarf down,sleep pizza! Then undefined.\r\n\r\n// Notice this is not what we want, but doesn't hard error out.\r\n\r\n// On the other hand, if I invoke apply() without passing the arguments as an array\r\n\r\nfavFood.apply(bob, 'scarf down', 'sleep') //Uncaught TypeError... hard error\r\n\r\n```\r\nBind is used to return a function that can be invoked at a later time. The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar eatThenSomething = favFood.bind(bob)\r\neatThenSomething('gobble', 'nap') //It's time to gobble spaghetti! Then nap.\r\n```\r\nNext example of bind()\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst obj  = {\r\n    x: 42,\r\n    getX: function() {\r\n        return this.x;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst unBoundX = obj.getX\r\nconsole.log(unBoundX()); // => undefined\r\n\r\n// But to get it to work\r\nconst boundX = unBoundX.bind(obj)\r\nconsole.log(boundX()); // => 42\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n"

It simply calls a provided function on each element in your array. This callback is allowed to mutate the calling array.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the map() method will also call a provided function on every element in the array. The difference is that map() utilizes return values and actually returns a new Array of the same size.\r\n\r\n### Return Value\r\n\r\nMDN Doc -\r\n**forEach** returns undefined\r\n**map** - returns A new array with each element being the result of the callback function.\r\n\r\nBoth the below will return undefined\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst array1 = [1, 2, 3]\r\n\r\nconst func = arr => {\r\n  const result = arr.forEach(i => i * 2)\r\n  return result\r\n}\r\nfunc() // Undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso the below\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst func1 = arr => {\r\n  return arr.forEach(i => i * 2)\r\n}\r\nfunc1() // undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Mutation\r\n\r\nforEach() affects and changes our original Array, whereas map() returns an entirely new Array — thus leaving the original array unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe map() method returns an entirely new array with transformed elements and the same amount of data. In the case of forEach(), even if it returns undefined, it will mutate the original array with the callback.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we see clearly that map() relies on immutability and forEach() is a mutator method.\r\n\r\nHence map() may be preferable if you favor functional programming.\r\n"

If we change the number of animals in the state Object:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet state = {\r\n  wardens: 900,\r\n  animals: 800\r\n};\r\nstate.animals = 90;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur state object will hold/encode a new information:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstate = {\r\n  wardens: 900,\r\n  animals: 90\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is called mutation.\r\n\r\nImmutability comes when we want to preserve our state. To keep our state from changing we have to create a new instance of our state objects.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction bad(state) {\r\n  state.prp = \"yes\";\r\n  return state;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction good(state) {\r\n  let newState = { ...state };\r\n  newState.prp = \"yes\";\r\n  return newState;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nImmutability makes our app state predictable, ups the performance rate of our apps and to easily track changes in state.\r\n\r\n#### Pure Functions, Side Effects\r\n\r\nPure functions are functions that accept an input and returns a value without modifying any data outside its scope(Side Effects). Its output or return value must depend on the input/arguments and pure functions must return a value.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction impure(arg) {\r\n  finalR.s = 90;\r\n  return arg * finalR.s;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above function is not a pure function because it modified a state finalR.s outside its scope.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction impure(arg) {\r\n  let f = finalR.s _ arg\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above function also isn’t a pure function because it didn’t return a value though it didn’t modify any external state.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction impure(arg) {\r\n  return finalR.s _ 3\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above function is impure, though it didn’t affect any external state, its output return finalR.s \\_ 3 isn't dependent on the input arg. Not only must pure function return a value but it must depend on the input.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction pure(arg) {\r\n  return arg \\_ 4\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above is a pure function. It didn’t side effect any external state and it returns an output based on the input.\r\n\r\n#### 1. A pure function is deterministic. This means, that given the same input, the function will always return the same output. To illustrate this as a function in mathematical terms it is a well defined function. Every input returns a single output, every single time.\r\n\r\nA pure function\r\n\r\n`const add = (x, y) => x + y` // A pure function\r\n\r\nadd is a pure function because it’s output is solely dependent on the arguments it receives. Therefore, given the same values, it will always produce the same output.\r\n\r\n#### 2. A pure function will not cause side effects. A side effect is any change in the system that is observable to the outside world.\r\n\r\n`const calculateBill = (sumOfCart, tax) => sumOfCart * tax`\r\n\r\nIs calculateBill pure? Definitely :) It exhibits the two necessary characteristics:\r\n\r\nThe function depends only on its arguments to produce a result\r\nThe function does not cause any side effects\r\nThe Mostly Adequate Guide states that side effects include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nchanging the file system\r\ninserting a record into a database\r\nmaking an http call\r\nmutations\r\nprinting to the screen / logging\r\nobtaining user input\r\nquerying the DOM\r\naccessing system state\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://hackernoon.com/javascript-and-functional-programming-pt-3-pure-functions-d572bb52e21c](https://hackernoon.com/javascript-and-functional-programming-pt-3-pure-functions-d572bb52e21c)\r\n"

                "content": "A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with **references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)**. In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.\r\n\r\n**A closure is a function** that retains access to variables of the context it was created in even after said function call has returned.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction init() {\r\n  var name = \"Mozilla\" // name is a local variable created by init\r\n  function displayName() {\r\n    // displayName() is the inner function, a closure\r\n    alert(name) // use variable declared in the parent function\r\n  }\r\n  displayName()\r\n}\r\ninit()\r\n```\r\n\r\ninit() creates a local variable called name and a function called displayName(). The displayName() function is an inner function that is defined inside init() and is available only within the body of the init() function. Note that the displayName() function has no local variables of its own. However, since inner functions have access to the variables of outer functions, displayName() can access the variable name declared in the parent function, init().\r\n\r\nThis is an example of lexical scoping, which describes how a parser resolves variable names when functions are nested. The word lexical refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. Nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar awFunc = function(first) {\r\n  var someFunc = function(second) {\r\n    return first + second\r\n  }\r\n  return someFunc // note that I did not invoke this function i.e. I did not use someFunc(), but I did returned the function itself\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar someMoreFunc = awFunc(\"awe\") // At this point awFunc has finished running\r\n\r\nconsole.log(someMoreFunc()) // This will return 'aweundefined'\r\n\r\nconsole.log(someMoreFunc(\"some\")) // returns awesome\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using Closures (Examples)\r\n\r\nAmong other things, closures are commonly used to give objects data privacy. Data privacy is an essential property that helps us program to an interface, not an implementation. This is an important concept that helps us build more robust software because implementation details are more likely to change in breaking ways than interface contracts.\r\n\r\nTo use a closure, simply define a function inside another function and expose it. To expose a function, return it or pass it to another function.\r\n\r\n#### In JavaScript, closures are the primary mechanism used to enable data privacy. When you use closures for data privacy, the enclosed variables are only in scope within the containing (outer) function. You can’t get at the data from an outside scope except through the object’s privileged methods. In JavaScript, any exposed method defined within the closure scope is privileged. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst getSecret = secret => {\r\n  return {\r\n    getPrivileged: () => secret,\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the `getPrivileged()` method is defined inside the scope of `getSecret()`, which gives it access to any variables from `getSecret()`, and makes it a privileged method. In this case, the parameter, `secret`.\r\n\r\n### Another example of closure\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst outerFunc = () => {\r\n  let name = \"Rohan\"\r\n\r\n  const closureFunc = () => {\r\n    console.log(name)\r\n  }\r\n  return closureFunc()\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar name = \"Paul\"\r\n\r\nouterFunc() // => Will Print 'Rohan'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### So whats going on above\r\n\r\nFirst, when a function runs, a new function Lexical Environment is created automatically. That’s a general rule for all functions. That Lexical Environment is used to store local variables and parameters of the call.\r\n\r\nDuring the function call we have two Lexical Environments: the inner one (for the function call) and the outer one (global):\r\n\r\nThe inner Lexical Environment corresponds to the current execution of that function.\r\n\r\nWhen code wants to access a variable – it is first searched for in the inner Lexical Environment, then in the outer one, then the more outer one and so on until the end of the chain.\r\n\r\nIf a variable is not found anywhere, that’s an error in strict mode. Without use strict, an assignment to an undefined variable creates a new global variable, for backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Some overall key points\r\n\r\n### Closure\r\n\r\n- A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them.\r\n- Combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared\r\n- The `closure` is the function object itself.\r\n- Accessing variables outside of the immediate lexical scope creates a closure.\r\n- Happens when we have a nested functions.\r\n- JavaScript engines also may optimize, discard variables that are unused to save memory.\r\n- A `Lexical Environment` object lives in the `heap` as long as there is a function which may use it. And when there are none, it is cleared.\r\n- All functions in JavaScript are closures.\r\n- The internal property `[[Environment]]` of a function, refers to the outer lexical environment\r\n"

In other words, a function defined and invoked inside another function is called closure. The closure has three scopes, all part of the same chain: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function's variables, and it has access to the global variables\r\nThe inner function has access not only to the outer function’s variables, but also to the outer function's parameters.\r\n\r\nExplanation - of above output from setTimeout()\r\n\r\nThe setTimeout function creates a function (the closure) that has access to its outer scope, which is the loop that contains the index i. After 1 second go by, the function is executed and it prints out the value of i, which at the end of the loop is at 4 because it cycles through 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and the loop finally stops at 4. And arr[4] does not exist, which is why you get undefined.\r\n\r\nThe variable i is actually declared within the for loop and the inner function accesses it. So when the for loop is done running, each of the inner functions refers to the same variable i, which at the end of the loop is equal to 3. Our goal is for each inner function to maintain its reference to the variable i without the value of it being altered.

So we now have 6 6 6 6 6 as the end result.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is because the setTimeout function creates a function (the closure) that has access to its outer scope, which is the for loop that contains the index i. After 1 second go by, the function is executed and it prints out the value of i, which at the end of the loop is at 6 because it cycles through 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and the loop finally stops at 6 .\r\n\r\nB) The problem resides in the variable i we’re passing into setTimeout(). In this case, we’re simply passing the reference to the variable i, and not the actual value at the moment inside each loop. Therefore, by the time the setTimeout() function is executed (after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 seconds in this case), the for statement has already been executed and incremented i to the final value of 6.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we are not passing value of i to the callback function of setTimeout(), instead what we are telling the callback function is too look for the variable i when it is executed at a later time. When the callback functions run, the variable i will be set to 6, since the callbacks will run after the loop completes... and that is why get the value 6.\r\n\r\nC) Explanation why the time interval is taking 1 second for consoling out the last value of 6 i.e. printing \"6\" five times with 1 second of time interval and NOT 6 seconds - Because, the setTimeout() function is only executed once (while setInterval() is for repeat execution ). And the i outside the curly braces (which is the second argument of the setInterval function ) takes the first value of i which is 1 second and get executed once and then stops.\r\n*/\r\n\r\n/* SOLUTION -\r\nTo print the successive values of i with an interval of 1 second, we need to pass into setTimeout() the actual value of i at the moment of each loop execution in the for statement.  */\r\n\r\nfuncToExecute = x => {\r\n  return () => {\r\n    console.log(x);\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n\r\nfor (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {\r\n  setTimeout(funcToExecute(i), i * 500);\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* More Explanation on why the delay is happening in the correct solution and not in the original solution -\r\n\r\nIn JavaScript you only have 2 ways of passing an argument....pass by value or pass by reference.\r\n\r\nIn the incorrect solution above in the loop, i is being passed by reference. So the loop is done by the time first console.log runs and and i is already at 6. To pass by reference in JavaScript, the argument has to be object.property. However in the loop case above, this is a exception where a variable is being passed as a reference to the value instead of the value itself.\r\n\r\nNow, other than the loop exception.... if you pass a variable as a arg into a function(x).... you are passing by value.

In JavaScript, a function can be executed by adding **()** after the function name, such as **X()**.\r\n\r\nWhen we execute X(), we are essentially executing the `inner` function.\r\n\r\nIf I run < console.log(X()) > the output will be below\r\n\r\n30\r\nundefined\r\n\r\nSo the closure function **inner**() is getting the value of **b = 10** from its enclosing **outer()** function ever after **outer()** function has returned.\r\n\r\n#### Let’s see step-by-step what happens when the outer() function is first invoked:\r\n\r\n- 1. Variable b is created, its scope is limited to the outer() function, and its value is set to 10.\r\n- 2. The next line is a function declaration, so nothing to execute.\r\n- 3. On the last line, return inner looks for a variable called inner, finds that this variable inner is actually a function, and so returns the entire body of the function inner.\r\n- 4. Note that the return statement does not execute the inner function — a function is executed only when followed by () — , but rather the return statement returns the entire body of the function.\r\n- 5. The contents returned by the return statement are stored in X.\r\n\r\nThus, X will store the following:\r\n\r\nfunction inner() {\r\nvar a=20;\r\nconsole.log(a+b);\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis can be easily verified by adding the following to the JavaScript code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(typeof X) //X is of type function\r\n```\r\n\r\n- 6. Function outer() finishes execution, and all variables within the scope of outer() now no longer exist.\r\n- 7. This last part is important to understand. Once a function completes its execution, any variables that were defined inside the function scope cease to exist.\r\n\r\nThe lifespan of a variable defined inside of a function is the lifespan of the function execution.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that in **console.log(a+b)**, the variable **b** exists only during the execution of the the **outer()** function. Once the outer function has finished execution, the variable b no longer exists.\r\n\r\nThis is the most important point to realize. The variables inside the functions only come into existence when the function is running, and cease to exist once the functions completes execution.\r\n\r\n##### Now see the main point of this exercise - that how a closure function retains its enclosing function's variable values, even after the enclosing function has returned.\r\n\r\n- A. When we execute X(), we are essentially executing the `inner` function.\r\n\r\n- B. If I run < console.log(X()) > the output will be below\r\n\r\n```\r\n30\r\nundefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n- C. So the closure function **inner**() is getting the value of **b = 10** from its enclosing **outer()** function ever after **outer()** function has returned.\r\n\r\n#### Let us examine step-by-step what happens when X() is executed the first time:\r\n\r\n- 1. Variable a is created, and its value is set to 20.\r\n- 2. JavaScript now tries to execute a + b. Here is where things get interesting. JavaScript knows that a exists since it just created it. However, variable b no longer exists. Since b is part of the outer function, b would only exist while the outer() function is in execution. Since the outer() function finished execution long before we invoked X(), any variables within the scope of the outer function cease to exist, and hence variable b no longer exists.\r\n\r\n#### Closures\r\n\r\n- A. The inner function can access the variables of the enclosing function due to closures in JavaScript. In other words, the inner function preserves the scope chain of the enclosing function at the time the enclosing function was executed, and thus can access the enclosing function’s variables.\r\n\r\n- B. In our example, the inner function had preserved the value of b=10 when the outer() function was executed, and continued to preserve (closure) it.\r\n\r\n- C. It now refers to its scope chain and notices that it does have the value of variable b within its scope chain, since it had enclosed the value of b within a closure at the point when the outer function had executed.\r\n\r\n- D. Thus, JavaScript knows a=20 and b=10, and can calculate a+b.\r\n\r\nSo the inner function has three scope chains:\r\n\r\naccess to its own scope — variable a\r\naccess to the outer function’s variables — variable b, which it enclosed\r\naccess to any global variables that may be defined\r\n\r\n##### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-closures-simplified-d0d23fa06ba4](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-closures-simplified-d0d23fa06ba4)\r\n"

            "content": "When we pass a callback function as an argument to another function, we are only passing the function definition. We are not executing the function in the parameter. In other words, we aren’t passing the function with the trailing pair of executing parenthesis () like we do when we are executing a function.\r\n\r\nAnd since the containing function has the callback function in its parameter as a function definition, it can execute the callback anytime.\r\n\r\n### Note that the callback function is not executed immediately. It is “called back” (hence the name) at some specified point inside the containing function’s body.\r\n\r\n### Callback Functions Are Closures\r\n\r\nWhen we pass a callback function as an argument to another function, the callback is executed at some point inside the containing function’s body just as if the callback were defined in the containing function. This means the callback is a closure. As we know, closures have access to the containing function’s scope, so the callback function can access the containing functions’ variables, and even the variables from the global scope.\r\n\r\n### Basic Principles when Implementing Callback Functions\r\n\r\n### 1> Use Named OR Anonymous Functions as Callbacks - Here's an example of named callback function\r\n\r\nIn most use case of Node/Express ecosystem, we use anonymous functions that were defined in the parameter of the containing function. That is one of the common patterns for using callback functions. Another popular pattern is to declare a **named function** and pass the name of that function to the parameter. Consider this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// global variable\r\nvar allUserData = [];\r\n\r\n// generic logStuff function that prints to console - this will be used as a callback function\r\nfunction logStuff(userData) {\r\n  if (typeof userData === \"string\") {\r\n    console.log(userData);\r\n  } else if (typeof userData === \"object\") {\r\n    for (var item in userData) {\r\n      console.log(item + \": \" + userData[item]);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// A function that takes two parameters, the last one a callback function\r\nfunction getInput(options, callback) {\r\n  allUserData.push(options);\r\n  callback(options);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// When we call the getInput function, we pass logStuff as a parameter.\r\n// So logStuff will be the function that will called back (or executed) inside the getInput function\r\ngetInput({ name: \"Rich\", speciality: \"JavaScript\" }, logStuff);\r\n//  name: Rich\r\n// speciality: JavaScript\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Make Sure Callback is a Function Before Executing It\r\n\r\nIt is always wise to check that the callback function passed in the parameter is indeed a function before calling it. Also, it is good practice to make the callback function optional.\r\n\r\nLet’s refactor the getInput function from the previous example to ensure these checks are in place.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction getInput(options, callback) {\r\n  allUserData.push(options);\r\n\r\n  // Make sure the callback is a function\r\n  if (typeof callback === \"function\") {\r\n    // Call it, since we have confirmed it is callable\r\n    callback(options);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the check in place, if the getInput function is called either without the callback function as a parameter or in place of a function a non-function is passed, our code will result in a runtime error.\r\n\r\n### Note the following ways we frequently use callback functions in JavaScript, especially in modern web application development, in libraries, and in frameworks: \r\n\r\nFor asynchronous execution (such as reading files, and making HTTP requests)\r\nIn Event Listeners/Handlers\r\nIn setTimeout and setInterval methods\r\nFor Generalization: code conciseness\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n1> https://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/\r\n"

The lexing process examines a string of source code characters and assigns semantic meaning to the tokens as a result of some stateful parsing.\r\n\r\nIt is this concept which provides the foundation to understand what lexical scope is and where the name comes from.\r\n\r\nTo define it somewhat circularly, lexical scope is scope that is defined at lexing time. In other words, lexical scope is based on where variables and blocks of scope are authored, by me, at write time, and thus is (mostly) set in stone by the time the lexer processes my code.\r\n\r\nIt is considered best practice to treat lexical scope as, in fact, lexical-only, and thus entirely author-time in nature.\r\n\r\nLet's consider this block of code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfoo = a => {\r\n  let b = a * 2\r\n\r\n  bar = c => {\r\n    console.log(a, b, c)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  bar(b * 3)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfoo(2) // => 2 4 12\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are three nested scopes inherent in this code example. It may be helpful to think about these scopes as bubbles inside of each other.\r\n\r\nBubble 1 encompasses the global scope, and has just one identifier in it: foo.\r\n\r\nBubble 2 encompasses the scope of foo, which includes the three identifiers: a, bar and b.\r\n\r\nBubble 3 encompasses the scope of bar, and it includes just one identifier: c.\r\n\r\nScope bubbles are defined by where the blocks of scope are written, which one is nested inside the other, etc. For our understanding just assume, that each function creates a new bubble of scope.\r\n\r\nThe bubble for bar is entirely contained within the bubble for foo, because (and only because) that's where we chose to define the function bar.\r\n\r\nNotice that these nested bubbles are strictly nested. We're not talking about Venn diagrams where the bubbles can cross boundaries. In other words, no bubble for some function can simultaneously exist (partially) inside two other outer scope bubbles, just as no function can partially be inside each of two parent functions.\r\n\r\n### Look-ups\r\n\r\nThe structure and relative placement of these scope bubbles fully explains to the _Engine_ all the places it needs to look to find an identifier.\r\n\r\nIn the above code snippet, the _Engine_ executes the `console.log(..)` statement and goes looking for the three referenced variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. It first starts with the innermost scope bubble, the scope of the `bar(..)` function. It won't find `a` there, so it goes up one level, out to the next nearest scope bubble, the scope of `foo(..)`. It finds `a` there, and so it uses that `a`. Same thing for `b`. But `c`, it does find inside of `bar(..)`.\r\n\r\nHad there been a `c` both inside of `bar(..)` and inside of `foo(..)`, the `console.log(..)` statement would have found and used the one in `bar(..)`, never getting to the one in `foo(..)`.\r\n\r\n**Scope look-up stops once it finds the first match**. The same identifier name can be specified at multiple layers of nested scope, which is called \"shadowing\" (the inner identifier \"shadows\" the outer identifier). Regardless of shadowing, scope look-up always starts at the innermost scope being executed at the time, and works its way outward/upward until the first match, and stops.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Global variables are also automatically properties of the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in node env), so it _is_ possible to reference a global variable not directly by its lexical name, but instead indirectly as a property reference of the global object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nwindow.a\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis technique gives access to a global variable which would otherwise be inaccessible due to it being shadowed. However, non-global shadowed variables cannot be accessed.\r\n\r\nNo matter _where_ a function is invoked from, or even _how_ it is invoked, its lexical scope is **only** defined by where the function was declared.\r\n\r\nThe lexical scope look-up process _only_ applies to first-class identifiers, such as the `a`, `b`, and `c`. If you had a reference to `foo.bar.baz` in a piece of code, the lexical scope look-up would apply to finding the `foo` identifier, but once it locates that variable, object property-access rules take over to resolve the `bar` and `baz` properties, respectively.\r\n"

            "content": "## Mutability\r\n\r\nOne of the key differentiating attributes between primitive data types and compound data types is that the former are immutable. This means that you cannot change a primitive value. It’s important that you internalize this principle because it makes a difference in how your code functions.\r\n\r\n## So what does it mean for a value to be immutable? - Trying Mutability on Primitives\r\n\r\nImagine that you have a variable called myInt and it holds the number value 5. No matter what methods you call on myInt, the value 5 itself will never change because numbers are one of the primitive types. 5 is always 5. This does not, however, mean that myInt the variable (as distinguished from the value of 5, which it happens to currently hold) can never change. You might run an expression that says myInt += 10, and indeed, myInt will now be 15. This is not mutation though, it is reassignment. 5 is still 5, but myInt is no longer pointing to it.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar someGreeting = \"hello\";\r\nvar otherGreeting = someGreeting;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(someGreeting);              // Logs: hello\r\nconsole.log(otherGreeting);             // Logs: hello\r\n\r\n// we have a variable, someGreeting, that contains the string value “hello” (a primitive type). We also have a second variable, otherGreeting, pointing to the same string value. If we mutated the string value being pointed to by these two variables, then we would expect both of the variables to reflect that change. So, we try to do this by calling the ostensibly transformative concat method on someGreeting\r\n\r\nsomeGreeting.concat(\"!!!\");   // return value: \"hello!!!\"\r\n\r\n//  however, when we then log the values of both someGreeting and otherGreeting, neither has changed. This is because strings are primitive and cannot be mutated. The concat method returned a new string but we didn’t do anything with it.\r\nconsole.log(someGreeting);              // Logs: hello\r\nconsole.log(otherGreeting);             // Logs: hello\r\n\r\n\r\n// Similarly, we can see that individual characters in a string can be accessed by index (as with an array); however, when we attempt to reassign one of those characters it has no result on the overall string, because again, strings are immutable.\r\n\r\nconsole.log(someGreeting[1]);           // Logs: e\r\nsomeGreeting[1] = \"a\";\r\nconsole.log(someGreeting[1]);           // Logs: e\r\n\r\n// we call concat() once more, this time using its return value to be reassigned to the someGreeting variable, and we do indeed see our expected change. But because this was reassignment, rather than mutation, otherGreeting is still pointing to the original value.\r\nsomeGreeting = someGreeting.concat(\"!!!\");  // reassignment\r\n\r\nconsole.log(someGreeting);              // Logs: hello!!!\r\nconsole.log(otherGreeting);             // Logs: hello\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Trying Mutability on Compound-data-types\r\n\r\nOK, so primitive types cannot be mutated, but what about compound types? Well, they most certainly can be mutated. Note however that compound types, as suggested by their name, are really data structures containing individual elements. Those individual elements could be either compound types themselves or primitive types. As you dig into the data structure, once you reach the primitives at the lowest level you reach data that cannot be mutated. Imagine an array of strings — the array is compound and mutable but the individual strings are primitive and immutable.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar favoritePlanets = [\"Mars\", \"Saturn\", \"Earth\"];\r\nconsole.log(favoritePlanets);     // Logs: [ 'Mars', 'Saturn', 'Earth' ]\r\n\r\n// we call the Array.prototype.sort method, which sorts an array in place (meaning that it mutates the original array), and as expected, our array changes.\r\nconsole.log(favoritePlanets);     // Logs: [ 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Saturn' ]\r\n\r\n// We push a new string to the array, and once more, we see that the array is mutated\r\nfavoritePlanets.push(\"Jupiter\");  // Logs:\r\nconsole.log(favoritePlanets);     // Logs: [ 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Saturn', 'Jupiter' ]\r\n\r\n\r\n// Next, I attempt to mutate the first element in the favoritePlanets array ( so could have naively expected the first element should have been 'Earth2' ) , but as we learned earlier this doesn’t actually work and so we get no change — thus demonstrating that compound types are mutable but the primitive types contained therein are not.\r\nfavoritePlanets[0].concat(\"2\");\r\nconsole.log(favoritePlanets);     // Logs: [ 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Saturn', 'Jupiter' ]\r\n\r\n\r\n// However, primitive types inside a compound type can be reassigned. We can see this below, when we define an object called lifeDiscovered and then reassign one of its elements. The lifeDiscovered object has been mutated by virtue of one of its parts being reassigned.\r\n\r\nvar lifeDiscovered = {\r\n  \"Earth\": true,\r\n  \"Mars\": false,\r\n  \"Titan\": false,\r\n};\r\n\r\nconsole.log(lifeDiscovered);\r\n  // Logs: { Earth: true, Mars: false, Titan: false }\r\n\r\nlifeDiscovered[\"Mars\"] = true;\r\nconsole.log(lifeDiscovered);\r\n  // Logs: { Earth: true, Mars: true, Titan: false }\r\n\r\n```"

            "content": "## JavaScript has two types of data types:\r\n\r\n## “primitive data types”, which are immutable; and, compound data types, which are mutable.\r\n\r\n## Seven primitive data types are:\r\n\r\n- Boolean\r\n- Null\r\n- Undefined\r\n- Number\r\n- String\r\n- Symbol (a unique and immutable primitive new to ES6/2015)\r\n- BigInt\r\n\r\nA BigInt is created by appending n to the end of an integer or by calling the constructor.\r\n\r\n## The non-primitive data types are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Object - represents instance through which we can access members\r\n- Array represents group of similar values. But console.log(typeof []) will give me 'object'\r\n- RegExp represents regular expression. But typeof /regex/ === 'object'\r\n\r\n#### BigInt\r\n\r\nBigInts are a new numeric primitive in JavaScript (ES2020) that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for Numbers.\r\n\r\nBigInt is a built-in object that provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than 2^(53) - 1, which is the largest number JavaScript can reliably represent with the Number primitive and represented by the Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER constant. BigInt can be used for arbitrarily large integers.\r\n\r\nThe BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for Numbers.\r\n\r\n#### Null vs Undefined\r\n\r\nWhat is null? - There are two features of null you should understand:\r\n\r\n- null is an empty or non-existent value.\r\n- null must be assigned.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example. We assign the value of null to a:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet a = null\r\nconsole.log(a)\r\n// null\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is undefined? - Undefined most typically means a variable has been declared, but not defined. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet b\r\nconsole.log(b)\r\n// undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n[differences-between-null-and-undefined-keywords-2e2m](https://dev.to/nunocpnp/differences-between-null-and-undefined-keywords-2e2m)\r\n\r\nDifference no 2 - Null and undefined are both primitives and falsy values. However null is also an object. Interestingly, this was actually an error in the original JavaScript implementation.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar a\r\nconsole.log(typeof a)\r\n// undefined\r\n\r\nvar b = null\r\nconsole.log(typeof b)\r\n// object\r\n```\r\n\r\nDifference no 3! - As you can see so far, null and undefined are different, but share some similarities. Thus, it makes sense that null does not strictly equal undefined.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(null !== undefined)\r\n// true\r\n// But, and this may surprise you, null loosely equals undefined.\r\nconsole.log(null == undefined)\r\n// true\r\n```\r\n\r\n## There are a variety of compound data types but the most common are: object; array; and function.\r\n\r\n## So what does it mean for a value to be immutable?\r\n\r\nImagine that you have a variable called myInt and it holds the number value 5. No matter what methods you call on myInt, the value 5 itself will never change because numbers are one of the primitive types. 5 is always 5. This does not, however, mean that myInt the variable (as distinguished from the value of 5, which it happens to currently hold) can never change. You might run an expression that says myInt += 10, and indeed, myInt will now be 15. This is not mutation though, it is reassignment. 5 is still 5, but myInt is no longer pointing to it.\r\n\r\nObject is a reference type. We will encounter problems about shallow copy and deep copy when using it.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet a = { name: \"FE\" }\r\nlet b = a\r\nb.name = \"EF\"\r\nconsole.log(a.name) // EF\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Type Conversion\r\n\r\n## Converting to Boolean\r\n\r\nWhen the condition is judged, other than `undefined`, `null`, `false`, `NaN`, `''`, `0`, `-0`, all of the values, including objects, are converted to `true`.\r\n\r\n## Objects to Primitive Types\r\n\r\nWhen objects are converted, `valueOf` and `toString` will be called, respectively in order. These two methods can also be overridden.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet a = {\r\n  valueOf() {\r\n    return 0\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n"

Specifically it is a double-precision format, meaning that 64 bits are allocated for each floating point.\r\n\r\nOf the 64 bits available, 1 bit is used for the sign – whether a number is positive or not. 11 bits are used for the exponent – this allows for up to 1024 as an exponent. The remaining 52 bits are allocated for the mantissa.\r\n\r\n### What is mantissa\r\n\r\nThe general form to represent floating point number\r\n\r\nD1.D2D3D4...Dp x BE\r\n\r\nThe sequence of p digits of D, D1.D2D3D4...Dp are called Significands or Mantissa. p is the number of significant digits, commonly called the Precision.\r\n\r\nWhen we use binary floating-point numbers, it will have some side effects. Here is an example of these side effects.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 // false\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the primitive data types, when we use literals to initialize a variable, the variable only has the literals as its value, it doesn’t have a type. It will be converted to the corresponding type only when necessary.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet a = 111 // only literals, not a number\r\na.toString() // converted to object when necessary\r\n```\r\n\r\nA Number object is created using the Number() constructor. A primitive type object number is created using the Number() function.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(Number(42)) // 42\r\nconsole.log(Number(\"42\")) // 42\r\nconsole.log(Number(\"paul\")) // NaN\r\n```\r\n\r\nFloating-point numbers\r\nTo represent a floating-point number, you include a decimal point followed by at least one number. See the following example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet f1 = 12.5\r\nlet f2 = 0.3 // same as 0.3, also valid but not recommended\r\n```\r\n\r\nJavaScript converts a floating-point number into an integer number if the number appears to be the whole number. The reason is that Javascript always wants to use less the memory since a floating-point value uses twice as much memory as an integer value.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet f3 = 200.0 // interpreted as integer 200\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Handling decimal places in JS\r\n\r\nAn oft-repeated bit of advice used by many, is to use the built-in toPrecision() and toFixed() methods on numbers. A big warning to anyone thinking of using them – those methods return strings. So if you have something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction foo(x, y) {\r\n  return x.toPrecision() + y.toPrecision()\r\n}\r\n\r\nfoo(0.1, 0.2) // \"0.10.2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction foo(x, y) {\r\n  return x.toFixed(2) + y.toFixed(2)\r\n}\r\n\r\nconsole.log(foo(0.1, 0.2))\r\n```\r\n"

Also called **double-precision floats**.

In binary, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 each have endless representations, just like 1/3 has the endless representation 0.333… in decimal\r\n\r\nAt some point, you need to cut off an endless representation, trading away accuracy for the ability to represent it in a finite space.\r\n\r\nIn other words, When you convert .1 or 1/10 to base 2 (binary) you get a repeating pattern after the decimal point, just like trying to represent 1/3 in base 10. The value is not exact, and therefore you can't do exact math with it using normal floating point methods.\r\n\r\n### Further Explanation\r\n\r\nThe crux of the problem is that numbers are represented in this format as a whole number times a power of two; rational numbers (such as 0.1, which is 1/10) whose denominator is not a power of two cannot be exactly represented.\r\n\r\nFor 0.1 in the standard binary64 format, the representation can be written exactly as\r\n\r\n```\r\n0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625 in decimal, or\r\n0x1.999999999999ap-4 in C99 hexfloat notation.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the rational number 0.1, which is 1/10, can be written exactly as\r\n\r\n```\r\n0.1 in decimal, or\r\n0x1.99999999999999...p-4\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nin an analogue of C99 hexfloat notation, where the ... represents an unending sequence of 9's.\r\n"

Luckily for us, in ES6 it’s much more straight forward. Whenever you are extending a baseclass and you need to invoke that baseclass’ constructor function, you invoke super passing it any arguments it needs.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Dog extends Animal {\r\n  constructor(name, energy, breed) {\r\n    super(name, energy) // calls Animal's constructor\r\n\r\n    this.breed = breed\r\n  }\r\n  bark() {\r\n    console.log('Woof Woof!')\r\n    this.energy -= .1\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nif you have a constructor in the subclass, you must have a constructor method in the parent class, even if it is a no-op function (and you have to call it). Why? The JS engine only attaches an object instance to the context variable (this) once you get to the highest prototype in the chain - which is Object. If you create a constructor, and then you don't call the parent constructor, you're essentially short circuiting or breaking the chain!\r\n\r\nThe only reason you have to do it (create the constructor in the parent class) is because the default return value from a constructor method call is the value of this. So if you don't create that parent constructor, then you will have no this value, and thus you'd be returning undefined, which is not ok in JavaScript constructors.\r\n\r\nWe call `super()` inside of a subclass' constructor method in order to call the parent constructor... and that's pretty much what super is in JavaScript: a reference to the parent prototype:\r\n\r\n**super()** method is mandatory to call if we have declared a custom constructor for Child Class, else not required. In line 23 above, the super keyword is used as a “function” which calls the parent class `ParentClass` with the parameters passed to `ChildClas`. This is a key step to be carried out in order to make sure that `ChildClas` is an instance of `ParentClass`.\r\n\r\n`super` is used to call Parent Class methods inside Child Class\r\n\r\nChild class will have access to all parent class methods.\r\n\r\nSeperate Note - An important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not. You first need to declare your class and then access it, otherwise code like the following will throw a ReferenceError:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst p = new Rectangle(); // ReferenceError\r\n\r\nclass Rectangle {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n- 1.

Inherited class inherits all the methods of parent class.\r\n\r\nLets see how to inherit a class from another class\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* Parent Class */\r\nclass ParentClass\r\n{\r\n   constructor(properties){\r\n     this.properties = properties;\r\n     }\r\n   getMothod(){return this.properties};\r\n   methods(){}\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*Inheriting class*/\r\nclass ChildClass extends ParentClass {\r\n    constructor(properties, classSpecificProperties) {\r\n         super(properties);\r\n         this.classSpecificProperties = classSpecificProperties\r\n     }\r\n    super.getMethod();\r\n    classSpecificeMethods(){}\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet childClassObject = new ChildClass(properties, classSpecificProperties);\r\n\r\nchildClassObject.methods();\r\n\r\nchildClassObject.classSpecificeMethods();\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Points to note:\r\n\r\nThere's really only one interesting bit here, if you have a constructor in the subclass, you must have a constructor method in the parent class, even if it is a no-op function (and you have to call it). Why? The JS engine only attaches an object instance to the context variable (this) once you get to the highest prototype in the chain - which is Object.

It sets it’s own property name as the value of the parameter passed into the function.\r\n\r\nWhile creating an object with construtor pattern, without using `this` keyword function and variables are private.\r\n\r\nA new object person is created using the constructor function. When you use new , it binds a newly created object to the this keyword within the called constructor function. This binding allows the person object to reference all the functionality from within the constructor function.\r\n\r\nThe object we just created has a property called `prototype`, and the value is just the Person object template! So when you call a function like greet() from the person object, the browser checks the person object for the function. If it’s not in that object, the browser checks to see if it’s declared within the prototype object that is a property of the person object. It goes up the “chain” of objects and their prototype properties until it either finds the function or doesn’t find it, which means the function is undefined. The prototype property is the place where inherited members are defined.\r\n\r\n#### Further reading\r\n\r\n[https://codeburst.io/object-oriented-programming-in-javascript-51b2bdfdfe9f](https://codeburst.io/object-oriented-programming-in-javascript-51b2bdfdfe9f)\r\n"

            "content": "#### You will find three different programming paradigms used to create JavaScript applications. They are Prototype-Based Programming, Object-Oriented Programming and Functional-Oriented Programming.\r\n\r\n#### Object Properties versus Variables\r\n\r\nAn object can store data in one of two ways: as a property or as a variable. The method that you choose will have substantial ramifications on data visibility. Object properties are created using the \"this.\" prefix. The name that follows the dot will identify a new property to add to the object's properties collection. That makes it a poor choice for storing private data. Variables, on the other hand, are created using the \"var\" keyword. It is subject to the rules of variable scoping and are more private for that reason. The following Person object contains a number of properties, accessible via setter and getter functions:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction Person() {\r\n\t//properties/fields\r\n\tthis.name = \"Rob Gravelle\";\r\n\tthis.height = 68;\r\n\tthis.weight = 170;\r\n\tthis.socialInsuranceNumber = \"555 555 555\";\r\n\r\n\t//methods/actions\r\n\tthis.setHeight = function(height) {\r\n\t\tthis.height = height;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.getHeight = function() {\r\n\t\treturn this.height;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.setWeight = function(weight) {\r\n\t\tthis.weight = weight;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.getWeight = function() {\r\n\t\treturn this.weight;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.setName = function(name) {\r\n\t\tthis.name = name;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.getName = function() {\r\n\t\treturn this.name;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.setSocialInsuranceNumber = function(socialInsuranceNumber) {\r\n\t\tthis.socialInsuranceNumber = socialInsuranceNumber;\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\treturn this;\r\n}\r\n//instanciate the Person class\r\nvar aPerson = new Person();\r\nvar myName = aPerson.getName(); //myName now contains \"Rob Gravelle\"\r\naPerson.setName(\"mud\"); //change the name\r\nvar myName = aPerson.getName(); //aPerson's name is now \"mud\"\r\nvar sinNo = aPerson.getSocialInsuranceNumber(); //will also throw an exception.  No getter implemented for that field!\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### We define these function by prepending the `this` keyword which makes them accessible from the outside (see Encapsulation). Notice that the functions have full access to the properties.\r\n\r\nto try calling the fields directly:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n//instanciate the Person class\r\nvar aPerson = new Person();\r\nvar myName = aPerson.name; //this works\r\n//as does this:\r\naPerson.name = \"whatever.\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe lesson here is that object member variables are public, while those that are stored as variables are private. Our second example uses variables instead of properties to hide all the data fields:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction Person() {\r\n\t//properties/fields\r\n\tvar name = \"Rob Gravelle\";\r\n\tvar height = 68;\r\n\tvar weight = 170;\r\n\tvar socialInsuranceNumber = \"555 555 555\";\r\n\r\n\t//methods/actions\r\n\tthis.setHeight = function(newHeight) {\r\n\t\theight = newHeight;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.getHeight = function() {\r\n\t\treturn height;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.setWeight = function(newWeight) {\r\n\t\tweight = newWeight;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.getWeight = function() {\r\n\t\treturn weight;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.setName = function(newName) {\r\n\t\tname = newName;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.getName = function() {\r\n\t\treturn name;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.setSocialInsuranceNumber = function(newSocialInsuranceNumber) {\r\n\t\tsocialInsuranceNumber = newSocialInsuranceNumber;\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\treturn this;\r\n}\r\n//instanciate the Person class\r\nvar aPerson = new Person();\r\nvar myName = aPerson.name; //this no longer works\r\nvar myName = aPerson.getName(); //this does\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that the setters' argument is named differently than the underlying variable. That's to avoid duplicate variables within the same scope.\r\n\r\n#### Encapsulation\r\n\r\nEncapsulation is the ability of an object to be a container (or capsule) for its member properties, including variables and methods. As a fundamental principle of object oriented programming (OOP), encapsulation plays a major role in languages such as C++ and Java. However, in scripting languages, where types and structure are not actively enforced by the compiler or interpreter, it is all-too-easy to fall into bad habits and write code that is brittle, difficult to maintain, and error-prone.\r\n\r\n#### We create objects with methods, properties, and attributes.\r\n\r\nWhen we make them bundled inside an object it’s known as encapsulation. When these methods and attributes are abstracted from other objects, this is known as abstraction.\r\n\r\nJavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property’s value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.\r\n\r\n#### Two principles with OOP in JS are:\r\n\r\nObject Creation Pattern (Encapsulation)\r\n\r\nObject Reuse Pattern (Inheritance)\r\n"

Most of the OOP languages provide access modifiers to restrict the scope of a variable, but their are no such access modifiers in JavaScript but their are certain way by which we can restrict the scope of variable within the Class/Object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction person(fname, lname) {\r\n  let firstname = fname;\r\n  let lastname = lname;\r\n\r\n  let getDetails_noaccess = function() {\r\n    return `First name is: ${firstname} Last\r\n    name is: ${lastname}`;\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  this.getDetails_access = function() {\r\n    return `First name is: ${firstname}, Last\r\n    name is: ${lastname}`;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\nlet person1 = new person(\"Mukul\", \"Latiyan\");\r\n\r\nconsole.log(person1.firstname); // => undefined\r\n\r\nconsole.log(person1.getDetails_noaccess); // => undefined\r\n\r\nconsole.log(person1.getDetails_access()); // => First name is: Mukul, Last    name is: Latiyan\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example we try to access some property(person1.firstname) and functions(person1.getDetails_noaccess) but it returns undefined.\r\n\r\nThe `firstnamel` and `getDetails_noaccess` variable is essentially private, which means we can no longer access it using x.myVal\r\n\r\nWhile, the getter method, there is a method- getDetails_access() - which we can access from the person object(person1.getDetails_access()), by changing the way to define a function we can restrict its scope.\r\n"

Instead we have to call the getter function:\r\n\r\nx.get()\r\n\r\n#### Closures enable a strong contract\r\n\r\nThe variable is conceptually “saved” inside the object returned from the function thanks to Javascript closures. This means that we can set the value with the setter method (i.e. x.set(2)), but attempting to directly change the field (i.e. x.myVal = 2) won’t do anything.\r\n\r\nThe greatest part of having these explicit setters and getters is that the object now has a strong contract/interface with the outside world. The state is fully encapsulated and the only ways in and out of the object is through the setters and getters.\r\n\r\nOne drawback about using closures is the issue of performance. While there doesn’t seem to be any difference when creating an object, method calls on the object using closures were about 80% slower.\r\n"

Each method is defined only once in the prototype chain and is available to every execution context objectized from foo. This limits the number of function objects that are created and does not risk the leaking of memory.\r\n\r\n3> []http://podefr.tumblr.com/post/55638600472/dont-use-javascript-prototypes-just-for-reducing](http://podefr.tumblr.com/post/55638600472/dont-use-javascript-prototypes-just-for-reducing)\r\n\r\nPrototypes in JavaScript are a way for implementing inheritance, and inheritance is a pattern for code reuse. One of the effects of code reuse is a lower memory footprint\r\n\r\n4> [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1871821/detecting-memory-leaks-in-javascript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1871821/detecting-memory-leaks-in-javascript)\r\n\r\nThe usual thing is to have the methods shared amongst instances by putting them on the prototype, and for instances to have small wrapper functions built in a well-contained closure context (e.g., one that doesn't close over extraneous data) -- usually created by a helper function for that reason -- that set up the call to the instance. That way, only small amounts of code are duplicated for each instance, the majority of it is shared."

            "content": "## MOST IMPORTANT KEY POINT OF USING PROTOTYPE - Method delegation can preserve memory resources because you only need one copy of each method to be shared by all instances. There are several ways to set up the relationship in JavaScript.\r\n\r\n## When you try to access a property on the new object, it checks the object’s own properties first. If it doesn’t find it there, it checks the `[[Prototype]]`, and so on up the prototype chain until it gets back to `Object.prototype`, which is the root delegate for most objects.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction Person (firstName, lastName) {\r\n    this.firstName = firstName,\r\n    this.lastName = lastName;\r\n    this.fullName = function() {\r\n        return (this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// console.log(Person.prototype)\r\n\r\nvar person1 = new Person(\"Bill\", \"Gates\");\r\nvar person2 = new Person(\"Steve\", \"Jobs\");\r\n\r\nconsole.log(person1.fullName()) // => Bill Gates\r\nconsole.log(person2.fullName()) // => Steve Jobs\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn executing the above code JavaScript engine will create two copy of constructor function each for person1 and person2. i.e. every object created using the constructor function will have it’s own copy of properties and methods. It doesn’t make sense to have two instances of function fullName that do the same thing. Storing separate instances of function for each objects results into wastage of memory.\r\n\r\nNow, to access the prototype of the above Person() function, I do `console.log(Person.prototype)` in a browser dev-tool and I get the below (here I am pasting it in Firefox)\r\n\r\n```\r\n{…}\r\n​\r\nconstructor: Person()\r\n​​\r\n    arguments: null\r\n    ​​\r\n    caller: null\r\n    ​​\r\n    length: 2\r\n    ​​\r\n    name: \"Person\"\r\n    ​​\r\n    prototype: {…}\r\n    ​​​\r\n        constructor: function Person()\r\n        ​​​\r\n        <prototype>: Object { … }\r\n        ​​\r\n        <prototype>: function ()\r\n    ​\r\n<prototype>: {…}\r\n​​\r\n    __defineGetter__: function __defineGetter__()\r\n    ​​\r\n    __defineSetter__: function __defineSetter__()\r\n    ​​\r\n    __lookupGetter__: function __lookupGetter__()\r\n    ​​\r\n    __lookupSetter__: function __lookupSetter__()\r\n    ​​\r\n    __proto__: Getter & Setter\r\n    ​​\r\n    constructor: function Object()\r\n    ​​\r\n    hasOwnProperty: function hasOwnProperty()\r\n    ​​\r\n    isPrototypeOf: function isPrototypeOf()\r\n    ​​\r\n    propertyIsEnumerable: function propertyIsEnumerable()\r\n    ​​\r\n    toLocaleString: function toLocaleString()\r\n    ​​\r\n    toSource: function toSource()\r\n    ​​\r\n    toString: function toString()\r\n    ​​\r\n    valueOf: function valueOf()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs shown in the above, Person constructor function has a prototype property which points to the prototype object. The prototype object has a constructor property which points back to the Person constructor function.\r\n\r\nWhen a function is created in JavaScript, JavaScript engine adds a prototype property to the function. This prototype property is an object (called as prototype object) has a constructor property by default. constructor property points back to the function on which prototype object is a property. We can access the function’s prototype property using the syntax `functionName.prototype.`\r\n\r\nAs seen from the above prototype property of the function is an object (prototype object) with two properties:\r\n\r\n### constructor property which points to Person function itself\r\n\r\n### **proto** property — We will discuss about this while explaining inheritance in JavaScript\r\n\r\n## Creating an object using the constructor function\r\n\r\n## When an object is created in JavaScript, JavaScript engine adds a **proto** property to the newly created object which is called as dunder proto. dunder proto or **proto** points to the prototype object of the constructor function.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"Prototype-Dev-Tool-1.png\">\r\n\r\nAs it can be seen from the above image, both person1’s dunder proto or **proto** property and Person.prototype property are equal let’s check if they point at the some location using === operator\r\n\r\n`Person.prototype === person1.__proto__ // => true`\r\n\r\nI can also check that\r\n\r\n`person1.__proto__ === person2.__proto__ // => true`\r\n\r\nEven person2’s dunder proto property is equal to the Person.prototype property and they points to the same object.\r\n\r\n## So, Prototype object of the constructor function is shared among all the objects created using the constructor function.\r\n\r\nAs prototype object is an object, we can attach properties and methods to the prototype object. Thus, enabling all the objects created using the constructor function to share those properties and methods.\r\n\r\nNew property can be added to the constructor function’s prototype property using either the dot notation or square bracket notation as shown below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//Dot notation\r\n\r\nPerson.prototype.name = \"Ashwin\";\r\n\r\nconsole.log(Person.prototype.name)  // => Output: Ashwin\r\n\r\n// Square bracket notation\r\n\r\nPerson.prototype[\"age\"] = 26;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(Person.prototype[\"age\"]);    // => Output: 26\r\n\r\nconsole.log(Person.prototype);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow an example of how JS Engine gets the property value from an object\r\n\r\n```\r\n//Create an empty constructor function\r\n\r\nfunction Person(){\r\n\r\n}\r\n//Add property name, age to the prototype property of the Person constructor function\r\n\r\nPerson.prototype.name = \"Ashwin\" ;\r\n\r\nPerson.prototype.age = 26;\r\n\r\nPerson.prototype.sayName = function(){\r\n\tconsole.log(this.name);\r\n}\r\n\r\n//Create an object using the Person constructor function\r\n\r\nvar person1 = new Person();\r\n\r\n//Access the name property using the person object\r\n\r\nconsole.log(person1.name)// Output\" Ashwin\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet’s analyze what happened when we did `console.log(person.name)` and `console.log(person1.name)` Let’s check if person object has name property.\r\n\r\nperson1 object is empty and it does not have any property except it’s dunder proto property. So how does the output of `console.log(person.name)` was “Ashwin”?\r\n\r\nWhen we try to access a property of an object, JavaScript engines first tries to find the property on the object; if the property is present on the object it outputs its value. But, if the property is not present on the object then it tries to find the property on the prototype object or dunder proto of the object. If the property is found the value is returned else JavaScript engine tries to find the property on the dunder proto of the dunder proto of the object. This chain continues till the dunder proto property is null. In this cases output will be undefined.\r\n\r\nSo, when person1.name is called, JavaScript engine checks if the property exists on the person object. In this case, name property was not on the person’s object. So, now JavaScript engine checks if the name property exists on the dunder proto property or the prototype of the person’s object. In this cases, name property was there on the dunder proto property or the prototype of person’s object. Hence, the output was returned “Ashwin”.\r\n\r\nNow, let’s define a property name on the person1 object\r\n\r\n```\r\nperson1.name = \"Anil\"\r\nconsole.log(person1.name)    // => Output: Anil\r\nconsole.log(person2.name)    // => Output: Ashwin\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere person1.name outputs “Anil”, because as mentioned earlier JavaScript engines first tries to find the property on the object itself as in case of person1 the property is present on the object JavaScript engines outputs value of name property of person1.\r\n\r\nIn case of person2, name property is not present on the object. Hence, it outputs person2’s prototype property name.\r\n\r\nAs prototype object is shared among all the objects created using the constructor function, it’s properties and methods are also shared among all the objects. If an object A modifies property of the prototype having primitive value, other objects will not be effected by this as A will create a property on its objects as shown abover. That `person2.name` did not change, even though `person1.name` was changed.\r\n\r\n# So Prototype vs Constructor way of declaring function\r\n\r\n## - Problem with constructor: Every object has its own instance of the function\r\n\r\n## - Problem with the prototype: Modifying a property using one object reflects the other object also\r\n\r\n## To solve above both problems, we can define all the object specific properties inside the constructor and all shared properties and methods insdie the prototype as shown below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//Define the object specific properties inside the constructor\r\nfunction Person(name, age) {\r\n    this.name = name;\r\n    this.age = age;\r\n    this.friends = [\"A\", \"B\"];\r\n\r\n    // Define the shared properties and methods using the prototype\r\n    Person.prototype.sayName = function(){\r\n\t    console.log(this.name);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //Create two objects using the Person constructor function\r\n    var person1 = new Person(\"Virat\", \"Kohli\");\r\n    var person2 = new Person(\"Sachin\", \"Tendulkar\");\r\n\r\n    //Lets check if person1 and person2 have points to the same instance of the sayName function\r\n    console.log(person1.sayName === person2.sayName) // => true\r\n\r\n    //Let's modify friends property and check\r\n    person1.friends.push(\"C\");\r\n\r\n    console.log(person1.friends)  // => Output: \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"\r\n    console.log(person2.frinds)   // => Output: \"A\", \"B\"\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## In the above example, friends property of person2 did not change on changing the friends property of person1. Because friends prop was a object specific prop.\r\n"

So, under the regular function construction way of defining (like in Prototypes-Prevents-Memory-Leaks-1-Good-Explanation.js), each new instance of function Person will have a copy of the same methods defined withing function Person. But with prototype, that method will be shared among all the instance of the Person function.\r\n\r\n#### Every JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]]. If you look up a property via obj.propName or obj['propName'] and the object does not have such a property - which can be checked via obj.hasOwnProperty('propName') - the runtime looks up the property in the object referenced by [[Prototype]] instead. If the prototype-object also doesn't have such a property, its prototype is checked in turn, thus walking the original object's prototype-chain until a match is found or its end is reached. If you create a new object via new Func(), the object's [[Prototype]] property will be set to the object referenced by Func.prototype.\r\n\r\n#### When you try to access a property on the new object, it checks the object’s own properties first. If it doesn’t find it there, it checks the `[[Prototype]]`, and so on up the prototype chain until it gets back to `Object.prototype`, which is the root delegate for most objects.\r\n\r\n#### The prototype is a property on a constructor function that sets what will become the **proto** property on the constructed object.\r\n\r\n#### Every object can have another object as its prototype. Then the former object inherits all of its prototype’s properties. An object specifies its prototype via the internal property [[Prototype]]. The chain of objects connected by the [[Prototype]] property is called the prototype chain:\r\n\r\n##### The **proto** is an accessor property of the Object.prototype object. It exposes the internal prototype linkage ( [[Prototype]]) of an object through which it is accessed. The **proto** is pronounced as dunder proto.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction Foo(name) {\r\n  this.name = name;\r\n}\r\nvar b = new Foo('b');\r\nvar a = new Foo('a');\r\nb.say = function() {\r\n  console.log('Hi from ' + this.whoAmI());\r\n}\r\nconsole.log(a.__proto__ === Foo.prototype); // true\r\nconsole.log(a.__proto__ === b.__proto__); // true\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimple implementation of Prototype based function definition\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar Person = function(name)  {\r\n    this.name = name;\r\n}\r\n\r\nPerson.prototype.getName = function() {\r\n    return this.name;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar john = new Person(\"John\")\r\n\r\njohn.getName() // => \"John\"\r\n\r\nPerson.prototype.sayName = function() {\r\n    return (`Hello, my name is ${this.getName()}`);\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Aren’t classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance really the same thing, just a stylistic preference?\r\n\r\n## Ans is No.\r\n\r\nClassical and prototypal inheritance are fundamentally and semantically distinct.\r\n\r\nIn class inheritance, instances inherit from a blueprint (the class), and create sub-class relationships. In other words, you can’t use the class like you would use an instance. You can’t invoke instance methods on a class definition itself. You must first create an instance and then invoke methods on that instance. a description of the object to be created. Classes inherit from classes and create subclass relationships: hierarchical class taxonomies.\r\n\r\nIn prototypal inheritance, instances inherit from other instances. A delegate prototype is an object that serves as a base for another object. When you inherit from a delegate prototype, the new object gets a reference to the prototype.\r\nA prototype is a working object instance. Objects inherit directly from other objects.”\r\n\r\nUsing delegate prototypes (setting the prototype of one instance to refer to an examplar object), it’s literally Objects Linking to Other Objects, or OLOO, as Kyle Simpson calls it.\r\n\r\nYou can attach delegate prototypes with `Object.create()` (an ES5 feature):\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet animal = {\r\n  animalType: 'animal',\r\n\r\n  describe () {\r\n    return `An ${this.animalType}, with ${this.furColor} fur,\r\n      ${this.legs} legs, and a ${this.tail} tail.`;\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nlet mouse = Object.assign(Object.create(animal), {\r\n  animalType: 'mouse',\r\n  furColor: 'brown',\r\n  legs: 4,\r\n  tail: 'long, skinny'\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet’s break this one down a little. `animal` is a delegate prototype. `mouse` is an instance. When you try to access a property on `mouse` that isn’t there, the JavaScript runtime will look for the property on `animal` (the delegate).\r\n`Object.assign()` is a new ES6 feature You pass in a destination object, and as many source objects as you like, separated by commas. It will copy all of the enumerable own properties by assignment from the source objects to the destination objects with last in priority. If there are any property name conflicts, the version from the last object passed in wins.\r\n\r\n`Object.create()` is an ES5 feature that was championed by Douglas Crockford so that we could attach delegate prototypes without using constructors and the `new` keyword.\r\n\r\n## Does `new` mean that code is using classical inheritance?\r\n\r\n## No.\r\n\r\nThe `new` keyword is used to invoke a constructor. What it actually does is:\r\n\r\nCreate a new instance\r\n\r\nBind `this` to the new instance\r\n\r\nReference the new object’s delegate [[Prototype]] to the object referenced by the constructor function’s `prototype` property.\r\n\r\n## What happens when new( ) an instance:\r\n\r\nNote that the prototype in Foo.prototype is not to form a prototype chain. Foo.prototype points to some where in a prototype chain, but this prototype property of Foo is not to form the prototype chain. What constitute a prototype chain are the **proto** pointing up the chain, and the objects pointed to by **proto**, such as going from foo.**proto**, going up to foo.**proto**.**proto**, and so forth, until null is reached.\r\n"

            "content": "### spread operator vs rest parameters\r\n\r\nFrom the definition we saw earlier, rest parameters collect all the remaining elements into an array. This allows us to do really neat function definitions. Let's see how we put them to use.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction add(x, y) {\r\n  return x + y\r\n}\r\n\r\nadd(1, 2, 3, 4) // => returns 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above function call returns 3, this is because in Javascript it is possible to call a function with any number of arguments. However, only the fist two arguments will be counted.\r\n\r\nWith rest parameters we can gather any number of arguments into an array and do what we want with them. So we can re-write the add function like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction add(...args) {\r\n  let result = 0\r\n\r\n  for (let arg of args) result += arg\r\n\r\n  return result\r\n}\r\n\r\nadd(1) // returns 1\r\nadd(1, 2) // returns 3\r\nadd(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) // returns 15\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Rest parameters have to be at the last argument. This is because it collects all remaining/ excess arguments into an array.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction xyz(x, y, ...z) {\r\n  console.log(x, \" \", y) // hey hello\r\n\r\n  console.log(z) // [\"wassup\", \"goodmorning\", \"hi\", \"howdy\"]\r\n  console.log(z[0]) // wassup\r\n  console.log(z.length) // 4\r\n}\r\n\r\nxyz(\"hey\", \"hello\", \"wassup\", \"goodmorning\", \"hi\", \"howdy\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The Rest Operator in React Example\r\n\r\nThe dots syntax can be also used to call the Rest operator in ES6. It's mostly useful when you want to avoid using the arguments object to access the passed arguments to a function.\r\n\r\nThis is an example pattern that uses the Rest operator to create authenticated routes in React using React Router:\r\n\r\n```JS\r\nconst AuthenticatedRoute = ({ ...rest }) => {\r\n  const id = this.state;\r\n  if (!id) {\r\n    return <Redirect to='/login' />;\r\n  }\r\n  return <Route {...rest} />;\r\n};\r\n\r\n// In Use\r\n<AuthenticatedRoute\r\n  path='/dashboard'\r\n  data={this.state.data}\r\n  render={() => (\r\n    <SomeComponent someProps={this.someProps} />\r\n  )}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther, First a look in JSX. When you do (scenario 1):\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<Component myProp={something} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe something typically is a JavaScript expression.\r\n\r\nWhen you use the spread operator,\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Component {...something} />\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen something should be a JavaScript object.\r\n\r\n### Now the spread operator\r\n\r\nThe spread operator allows us to expand elements. With rest parameters we were able to get a list of arguments into an array. spread operators however, let us unpack elements in an array to single/individual arguments.\r\n\r\nAdding array elements to an existing array\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst arr = [\"Joy\", \"Wangari\", \"Warugu\"]\r\nconst newArr = [\"joykare\", ...arr]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe value of newArr will be [ 'joykare', 'Joy', 'Wangari', 'Warugu' ]. Note: Unlike rest parameters you can use the spread operator as the first argument. So if you wanted to add an element as the last element in your array you cna do this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst myNames = [...arr, \"joykare\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe value of myNames in this case will be [ 'Joy', 'Wangari', 'Warugu', 'joykare' ].\r\n\r\n#### Copying arrays\r\n\r\nWe can use the spread operator to copy an array.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3]\r\nconst arr2 = [...arr]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis copies arr into arr2. Now we can do things on arr2 and any changes done to arr2 will not have any effect arr.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to MERGE OBJECTS - Spread properties also provide a new way to merge two or more objects, which can be used as an alternative to the Object.assign() method: - This is VERY IMPORTANT\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst obj1 = { a: 10 }\r\nconst obj2 = { b: 20 }\r\nconst obj3 = { c: 30 }\r\n\r\n// ES2018\r\nconsole.log({ ...obj1, ...obj2, ...obj3 }) // → {a: 10, b: 20, c: 30}\r\n\r\n// ES2015\r\nconsole.log(Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2, obj3)) // → {a: 10, b: 20, c: 30}\r\n```\r\n"

If log the loop counter inside setTimeout, what will be logged?\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\r\n  setTimeout(function () {\r\n    console.log(i)\r\n  }, 10)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Answer**: The above will not output the numbers 0 through 9, but will simply print the number 10 ten times.\r\n\r\n**Explanation**: The console log is inside the anonymous function of setTimeout and setTimeout is executed when current call stack is over. So, the loop finishes and before setTimeout get the chance to execute. However, anonymous functions keep a reference to i by creating a closure. Since, the loop is already finished, the value i has been set to 10. When setTimeout use the value of i by reference, it gets the value of i as 10. Hence, you see 10 ten times.\r\n\r\n**Solution**: You can fix it by avoiding closure. Just create a IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), it will create its own scope and you can pass i to the function. In that case i will be a local variable (will not refer to i in the closure) and value of the i in every loop will be preserved.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\r\n  setTimeout(\r\n    (function (i) {\r\n      console.log(i)\r\n    })(i),\r\n    10\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Alternative Solution**: Look at the code below and use your brain (if any).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\r\n  setTimeout(console.log.bind(console, i), 10)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n"

The plus operator between a number and a boolean or two boolean will convert boolean to number. Hence, true converts to 1 and you get result of 2+1\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Question: What is `'6'+9`\r\n\r\n**Answer**: 69. If one of the operands of the plus (+) operator is string it will convert other number or boolean to string and perform a concatenation. For the same reason, \"2\"+true will return \"2true\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Question: What is the value of `4+3+2+\"1\"`\r\n\r\n**Answer**: 91 . The addition starts from the left, 4+3 results 7 and 7+2 is 9. So far, the plus operator is performing addition as both the operands are number.

Hence, -'34' becomes, -34 and then plus (+) will perform simple addition as both the operands are number.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Question: What is the value of `+'dude'`\r\n\r\n**Answer**: NaN. The plus (+) operator in front of a string is an unary operator that will try to convert the string to number.

The problem is that 0.1 and 0.2 and 0.3 are not exactly representable as javascript (or C or Java etc) floats. Thus the output you are seeing is due to that inaccuracy.\r\n\r\nIn particular only certain sums of powers of two are exactly representable. 0.5 = =0.1b = 2^(-1), 0.25=0.01b=(2^-2), 0.75=0.11b = (2^-1 + 2^-2) are all OK. But 1/10 = 0.000110001100011..b can only be expressed as an infinite sum of powers of 2, which the language chops off at some point. Its this chopping that is causing these slight errors.\r\n\r\n**Further Explanation**\r\n\r\nFrom [The Floating-Point Guide][1]:\r\n\r\n**Why don’t my numbers, like `0.1 + 0.2` add up to a nice round `0.3`, and\r\ninstead I get a weird result like `0.30000000000000004`?**\r\n\r\nBecause internally, computers use a format (binary floating-point) that cannot accurately represent a number like 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 at all.\r\nWhen the code is compiled or interpreted, your “0.1” is already rounded to the nearest number in that format, which results in a small rounding error even before the calculation happens.\r\n\r\nThe site has detailed explanations as well as information on how to fix the problem (and how to decide whether it is a problem at all in your case).\r\n\r\n[1]: http://floating-point-gui.de/\r\n\r\n##### For a very detailed ans to this above question, collected from various blogs - see this file\r\n\r\n[why-does-adding-two-decimals-in-javascript-produce-a-wrong-result](why-does-adding-two-decimals-in-javascript-produce-a-wrong-result.md)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Question: `42..toString()`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Answer:** \"42\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Question: `4.2..toString`\r\n\r\n**Answer:** //SyntaxError: Unexpected token .\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Question: 42 . toString()\r\n\r\n**Answer:** \"42\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Question: What is typeof(NaN) ? And why is `NaN === NaN` or `NaN == NaN` returning false.\r\n\r\n**Answer:**\"number\"\r\n\r\n`NaN != NaN` because they are not necessary the SAME non-number. Thus it makes a lot of sense...\r\nAlso why floats have both +0.00 and -0.00 that are not the same. Rounding may do that they are actually not zero.\r\n\r\nAs for typeof, that depends on the language. And most languages will say that NaN is a float, double or number depending on how they classify it... I know of no languages that will say this is an unknown type or null.\r\n\r\n#### More Explanations\r\n\r\n###### It is not a peculiarity of javascript but common computer science principle.\r\n\r\nFrom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN:\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of operation which return NaN:\r\n\r\nOperations with a NaN as at least one operand\r\n\r\nIndeterminate forms\r\n\r\n- The divisions 0/0, ∞/∞, ∞/−∞, −∞/∞, and −∞/−∞\r\n- The multiplications 0×∞ and 0×−∞\r\n- The power 1^∞\r\n- The additions ∞ + (−∞), (−∞) + ∞ and equivalent subtractions.\r\n\r\nReal operations with complex results:\r\n\r\n- The square root of a negative number\r\n- The logarithm of a negative number\r\n- The tangent of an odd multiple of 90 degrees (or π/2 radians)\r\n- The inverse sine or cosine of a number which is less than −1 or\r\n  greater than +1.\r\n\r\nAll these values may not be the same. A simple test for a NaN is to test `value == value` is false.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nQuestion: What is `2 in [1,2]`\r\n\r\n**Answer:** false.

So it works the same as if you asked it to convert `\"Infinity\"` in base 19 to decimal.\r\n\r\nHere are the digits in base 19 along with their decimal values:\r\n\r\n<!-- language: lang-none -->\r\n\r\n    Base 19   Base 10 (decimal)\r\n    ---------------------------\r\n       0            0\r\n       1            1\r\n       2            2\r\n       3            3\r\n       4            4\r\n       5            5\r\n       6            6\r\n       7            7\r\n       8            8\r\n       9            9\r\n       a            10\r\n       b            11\r\n       c            12\r\n       d            13\r\n       e            14\r\n       f            15\r\n       g            16\r\n       h            17\r\n       i            18\r\n\r\nWhat happens next is that `parseInt` scans the input `\"Infinity\"` to find which part of it can be parsed and stops after accepting the first `I` (because `n` is not a valid digit in base 19).\r\n\r\nTherefore it behaves as if you called `parseInt(\"I\", 19)`, which converts to decimal 18 by the table above.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Infinity\r\n[2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt\r\n\r\n### Explanation-2\r\n\r\nHere's the sequence of events:\r\n\r\n- `1/0` evaluates to `Infinity`\r\n- `parseInt` reads `Infinity` and happily notes that `I` is 18 in base 19\r\n- `parseInt` ignores the remainder of the string, since it can't be converted.\r\n\r\nNote that you'd get a result for any base `>= 19`, but not for bases below that. For bases `>= 24`, you'll get a larger result, as `n` becomes a valid digit at that point.\r\n\r\n### Explanation-3\r\n\r\nTo add to the above answers\r\n\r\n`parseInt(1/0,19)` is equivalent to `parseInt(\"Infinity\",19)`\r\n\r\nWithin base 19 numbers `0-9` and `A-I` `(or a-i)` are a valid numbers. So, from the \"Infinity\" it takes `I` of base 19 and converts to base 10 which becomes 18\r\nThen it tries to take the next character i.e. `n` which is not present in base 19 so discards next characters (as per javascript's behavior of converting string to number)\r\n\r\nSo, if you write `parseInt(\"Infinity\",19)` OR `parseInt(\"I\",19)` OR `parseInt(\"i\",19)` the result will be same i.e `18`.\r\n\r\nNow, if you write `parseInt(\"I0\",19)` the result will be `342`\r\nas `I X 19 (the base)^1 + 0 X 19^0` = `18 X 19^1 + 0 X 19^0` = `18 X 19 + 0 X 1` = `342`\r\n\r\nSimilarly, `parseInt(\"I11\",19)` will result in `6518`\r\n\r\ni.e.\r\n\r\n```\r\n      18 X 19^2  +   1 X 19^1   +  1 X 19^0\r\n    = 18 X 19^2  +   1 X 19^1   +  1 X 19^0\r\n    = 18 X 361   +   1 X 19     +  1 X 1\r\n    = 6498  +  19  +  1\r\n    = 6518\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Question - Explain the difference between Object.freeze() vs const\r\n\r\n#### Answer\r\n\r\n`const` and `Object.freeze` are two completely different things.\r\n\r\n`const` applies to bindings (\"variables\"). It creates an immutable binding, i.e. you cannot assign a new value to the binding.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst person = {\r\n  name: \"Leonardo\",\r\n}\r\nlet animal = {\r\n  species: \"snake\",\r\n}\r\nperson = animal // ERROR \"person\" is read-only\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Object.freeze` works on values, and more specifically, object values. It makes an object immutable, i.e. you cannot change its properties.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet person = {\r\n  name: \"Leonardo\",\r\n}\r\nlet animal = {\r\n  species: \"snake\",\r\n}\r\nObject.freeze(person)\r\nperson.name = \"Lima\" //TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'name' of object\r\nconsole.log(person)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### [More explanations](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51858981/1902852)\r\n\r\n## Summary:\r\n\r\n`const` and `Object.freeze()` serve totally different purposes.\r\n\r\n- `const` is there for declaring a variable which has to assinged right away and can't be reassigned. variables declared by `const` are block scoped and not function scoped like variables declared with `var`\r\n- `Object.freeze()` is a method which accepts an object and returns the same object. Now the object cannot have any of its properties removed or any new properties added.\r\n\r\n## Examples `const`:\r\n\r\n**Example 1: Can't reassign `const`**\r\n\r\n```\r\n    const foo = 5;\r\n\r\n    foo = 6;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following code throws an error because we are trying to reassign the variable foo who was declared with the `const` keyword, we can't reassign it.\r\n\r\n**Example 2: Data structures which are assigned to `const` can be mutated**\r\n\r\n```\r\n    const object = {\r\n      prop1: 1,\r\n      prop2: 2\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    object.prop1 = 5;   // object is still mutable!\r\n    object.prop3 = 3;   // object is still mutable!\r\n\r\n    console.log(object);  // object is mutated\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example we declare a variable using the `const` keyword and assign an object to it. Although we can't reassign to this variable called object, we can mutate the object itself. If we change existing properties or add new properties this will this have effect. To disable any changes to the object we need `Object.freeze()`.\r\n\r\n## Examples `Object.freeze()`:\r\n\r\n**Example 1: Can't mutate a frozen object**\r\n\r\n<!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false -->\r\n\r\n<!-- language: lang-js -->\r\n\r\n    object1 = {\r\n      prop1: 1,\r\n      prop2: 2\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    object2 = Object.freeze(object1);\r\n\r\n    console.log(object1 === object2); // both objects are refer to the same instance\r\n\r\n    object2.prop3 = 3; // no new property can be added, won't work\r\n\r\n    delete object2.prop1; // no property can be deleted, won't work\r\n\r\n    console.log(object2); // object unchanged\r\n\r\n<!-- end snippet -->\r\n\r\nIn this example when we call `Object.freeze()` and give `object1` as an argument the function returns the object which is now 'frozen'. If we compare the reference of the new object to the old object using the `===` operator we can observe that they refer to the same object. Also when we try to add or remove any properties we can see that this does not have any effect (will throw error in strict mode).\r\n\r\n**Example 2: Objects with references aren't fully frozen**\r\n\r\n<!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false -->\r\n\r\n<!-- language: lang-js -->\r\n\r\n    const object = {\r\n      prop1: 1,\r\n      nestedObj: {\r\n        nestedProp1: 1,\r\n        nestedProp2: 2,\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    const frozen = Object.freeze(object);\r\n\r\n    frozen.prop1 = 5; // won't have any effect\r\n    frozen.nestedObj.nestedProp1 = 5; //will update because the nestedObject isn't frozen\r\n\r\n    console.log(frozen);\r\n\r\n<!-- end snippet -->\r\n\r\nThis example shows that the properties of nested objects (and other by reference data structures) are **still mutable**. So `Object.freeze()` doesn't fully 'freeze' the object when it has properties which are references (to e.g. Arrays, Objects).\r\n"

What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?\r\n\r\nIIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expressions. The JavaScript parser reads function foo(){ }(); as function foo(){ } and ();, where the former is a function declaration and the latter (a pair of parentheses) is an attempt at calling a function but there is no name specified, hence it throws Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ).\r\n\r\nHere are two ways to fix it that involves adding more parentheses:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n(function foo(){ })() and (function foo(){ }()).\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nStatements that begin with function are considered to be function declarations; by wrapping this function within (), it becomes a function expression which can then be executed with the subsequent (). These functions are not exposed in the global scope and you can even omit its name if you do not need to reference itself within the body.\r\n\r\nYou might also use void operator: void function foo(){ }();. Unfortunately, there is one issue with such approach. The evaluation of given expression is always undefined, so if your IIFE function returns anything, you can't use it.

Assigning a new value to it does not change the value of the type undefined.\r\n\r\n### 8 Ways to get Undefined:\r\n\r\n- A declared variable without assigning any value to it.\r\n- Implicit returns of functions due to missing return statements.\r\n- return statements that do not explicitly return anything.\r\n- Lookups of non-existent properties in an object.\r\n- Function parameters that have not passed.\r\n- Anything that has been set to the value of undefined.\r\n- Any expression in the form of void(expression)\r\n- The value of the global variable undefined\r\n\r\n### null\r\n\r\nnull means empty or non-existent value which is used by programmers to indicate “no value”. null is a primitive value and you can assign null to any variable. null is not an object, it is a primitive value. For example, you cannot add properties to it. Sometimes people wrongly assume that it is an object, because typeof null returns \"object\".\r\n\r\nBtw, null == undefined\r\n\r\nref: [history of typeof null](http://www.2ality.com/2013/10/typeof-null.html)\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding examples, it is clear that `undefined` and `null` are two distinct types: `undefined` is a type itself (undefined) while `null` is an object.\r\n\r\n    null === undefined // false\r\n    null == undefined // true\r\n    null === null // true\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    null = 'value' // ReferenceError\r\n    undefined = 'value' // 'value'\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Practical Differences\r\n\r\nAll of this is great, but what about a practical difference between null and undefined?\r\n\r\nConsider the following code snippet:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet logHi = (str = \"hi\") => {\r\n  console.log(str)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code above creates a function named logHi. This function requires one parameter and sets the default of that parameter to hi if it isn’t supplied. Here’s what that looks like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlogHi()\r\n// hi\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can also supply a parameter to overwrite this default:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlogHi(\"bye\")\r\n// bye\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith default parameters, undefined will use the default while null does not.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlogHi(undefined)\r\n// hi\r\nlogHi(null)\r\n// null\r\n```\r\n"

How can this pitfall be avoided?\r\n\r\n#### Answer\r\n\r\nAlthough `typeof bar === \"object\"` is a reliable way of checking if bar is an object, the surprising gotcha in JavaScript is that null is also considered an object!\r\n\r\nTherefore, the following code will, to the surprise of most developers, log true (not false) to the console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar bar = null;\r\nconsole.log(typeof bar === \"object\");  // logs true!\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs long as one is aware of this, the problem can easily be avoided by also checking if bar is null:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsole.log((bar !== null) && (typeof bar === \"object\"));  // logs false\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo be entirely thorough in our answer, there are two other things worth noting:\r\n\r\nFirst, the above solution will return false if bar is a function. In most cases, this is the desired behavior, but in situations where you want to also return true for functions, you could amend the above solution to be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsole.log((bar !== null) && ((typeof bar === \"object\") || (typeof bar === \"function\")));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, the above solution will return true if bar is an array (e.g., if var bar = [];). In most cases, this is the desired behavior, since arrays are indeed objects, but in situations where you want to also false for arrays, you could amend the above solution to be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsole.log((bar !== null) && (typeof bar === \"object\") && (toString.call(bar) !== \"[object Array]\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, there’s one other alternative that returns false for nulls, arrays, and functions, but true for objects:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsole.log((bar !== null) && (bar.constructor === Object));\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you’re using jQuery:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsole.log((bar !== null) && (typeof bar === \"object\") && (! $.isArray(bar)));\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nES5 makes the array case quite simple, including its own null check:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsole.log(Array.isArray(bar));\r\n```\r\n"

            "content": "### Question: What is typeof(NaN) ? And why is `NaN === NaN` or `NaN == NaN` returning false.\r\n\r\n**Answer:**\"number\"\r\n\r\n[From this excellent Blog](https://javascriptrefined.io/nan-and-typeof-36cd6e2a4e43)\r\n\r\nFirst, NaN is not a keyword (unlike true, false, null, etc..), it is a property of the global object. The value of NaN is the same as the value of Number.NaN:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nNaN // NaN\r\nNumber.NaN // NaN\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are several ways in which NaN can happen:\r\n\r\n- Division of zero by zero\r\n- Dividing an infinity by an infinity\r\n- Multiplication of an infinity by a zero\r\n- Any operation in which NaN is an operand\r\n- Converting a non-numeric string or undefined into a number\r\n\r\nThe ECMAScript standard states that Numbers should be IEEE-754 floating point data. This includes Infinity, -Infinity, and also NaN.\r\nBy definition, NaN is the return value from operations which have an undefined numerical result. Hence why, in JavaScript, aside from being part of the global object, it is also part of the Number object: Number.NaN. It is still a numeric data type, but [it is undefined as a real number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number).\r\nNaN also represents any number outside of the ECMAScript domain of definition.\r\n\r\nNaN is unordered\r\nAccording to the IEEE 754 floating-point standard, comparison with NaN always returns an unordered result. That is, NaN is not equal to, greater than, or less than anything, including itself:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nNaN < 1 // false\r\nNaN > 1 // false\r\nNaN == NaN // false\r\n// But we can still check for NaN:\r\nisNaN(NaN) // true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is why you cannot determine whether a given value is NaN by comparing it to NaN, and instead you must use the isNaN() function.\r\nIt is not surprising, then, that the native implementation of the function isNaN() could be simply replaced with:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Native implementation\r\nfunction isNaN(x) {\r\n  // Coerce into number\r\n  x = Number(x)\r\n  // if x is NaN, NaN != NaN is true, otherwise it's false\r\n  return x != x\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Booleans are not NaNs\r\n\r\nConsider the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nisNaN(true);  // false\r\nisNaN(false); // false\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because booleans are considered and implemented as numerical values with a single binary digit (i.e., bit), thus they are coerced into their respective bit representations:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nNumber(true) // 1\r\nNumber(false) // 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Now Various Explanations from Blogs and [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2801601/why-does-typeof-nan-return-number)\r\n\r\n#### Explanations-1\r\n\r\n`NaN != NaN` because they are not necessary the SAME non-number. Thus it makes a lot of sense...\r\nAlso why floats have both +0.00 and -0.00 that are not the same. Rounding may do that they are actually not zero.\r\n\r\nAs for typeof, that depends on the language. And most languages will say that NaN is a float, double or number depending on how they classify it... I know of no languages that will say this is an unknown type or null.\r\n\r\n###### It is not a peculiarity of javascript but common computer science principle.\r\n\r\nFrom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN:\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of operation which return NaN:\r\n\r\nOperations with a NaN as at least one operand\r\n\r\nIndeterminate forms\r\n\r\n- The divisions 0/0, ∞/∞, ∞/−∞, −∞/∞, and −∞/−∞\r\n- The multiplications 0×∞ and 0×−∞\r\n- The power 1^∞\r\n- The additions ∞ + (−∞), (−∞) + ∞ and equivalent subtractions.\r\n\r\nReal operations with complex results:\r\n\r\n- The square root of a negative number\r\n- The logarithm of a negative number\r\n- The tangent of an odd multiple of 90 degrees (or π/2 radians)\r\n- The inverse sine or cosine of a number which is less than −1 or\r\n  greater than +1.\r\n\r\nAll these values may not be the same. A simple test for a NaN is to test `value == value` is false.\r\n\r\n#### Explanations-2\r\n\r\n`NaN != NaN` because they are not necessary the SAME non-number. Thus it makes a lot of sense...\r\nAlso why floats have both +0.00 and -0.00 that are not the same. Rounding may do that they are actually not zero.\r\n\r\nAs for typeof, that depends on the language. And most languages will say that NaN is a float, double or number depending on how they classify it... I know of no languages that will say this is an unknown type or null.\r\n\r\n#### Explanation-3\r\n\r\n`NaN` just means the specific value cannot be represented within the limitations of the numeric type (although that could be said for all numbers that have to be rounded to fit, but `NaN` is a special case).\r\n\r\nA specific `NaN` is not considered equal to another `NaN` because they may be different values. However, `NaN` is still a number type, just like 2718 or 31415.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo explain in layman's terms:\r\n\r\nA comparison with a NaN always returns an unordered result even when comparing with itself. The comparison predicates are either signalling or non-signalling, the signalling versions signal an invalid exception for such comparisons. The equality and inequality predicates are non-signalling so x = x returning false can be used to test if x is a quiet NaN.\r\n\r\nAll this means is (broken down into parts):\r\n\r\nA comparison with a NaN always returns an unordered result even when comparing with itself.\r\n\r\nBasically, a `NaN` is not equal to any other number, including another `NaN`, and even including _itself_.\r\n\r\nThe comparison predicates are either signalling or non-signalling, the signalling versions signal an invalid exception for such comparisons.\r\n\r\nAttempting to do comparison (less than, greater than, and so on) operations between a `NaN` and another number can either result in an exception being thrown (signalling) or just getting false as the result (non-signalling or quiet).\r\n\r\nThe equality and inequality predicates are non-signalling so x = x returning false can be used to test if x is a quiet NaN.\r\n\r\nTests for equality (equal to, not equal to) are never signalling so using them will not cause an exception. If you have a regular number `x`, then `x == x` will always be true. If `x` is a `NaN`, then `x == x` will always be false. It's giving you a way to detect `NaN` easily (quietly).\r\n\r\n#### Important References to Standards\r\n\r\nThe ECMAScript (JavaScript) standard specifies that `Numbers` are [IEEE 754](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) floats, which include `NaN` as a possible value.\r\n\r\n### [ECMA 262 5e Section 4.3.19](http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_Section_4.htm#Section_4.3.19): Number value\r\n\r\nprimitive value corresponding to a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value.\r\n\r\n### [ECMA 262 5e Section 4.3.23](http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_Section_4.htm#Section_4.3.23): NaN\r\n\r\nNumber value that is a IEEE 754 \"Not-a-Number\" value.\r\n\r\n### [IEEE 754](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) on Wikipedia\r\n\r\nThe IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic is a technical standard established by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the most widely used standard for floating-point computation [...]\r\n\r\nThe standard defines\r\n\r\n- _arithmetic formats_: sets of binary and decimal floating-point data, which consist of finite numbers (including signed zeros and subnormal numbers), infinities, and **special \"not a number\" values (NaNs)**\r\n"

The type tag for objects was 0. <code>null</code> was represented as the NULL pointer (0x00 in most platforms). Consequently, null had 0 as type tag, hence the \"object\" <code>typeof</code> return value. (<a href=\"http://www.2ality.com/2013/10/typeof-null.html\">reference</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fix was proposed for ECMAScript (via an opt-in), but <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160331031419/http://wiki.ecmascript.org:80/doku.php?id=harmony:typeof_null\">was rejected</a>. It would have resulted in <code>typeof null === 'null'</code>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n[1]: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:typeof_null\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##### Explanation-3\r\n\r\nThis page has a nice description of the history here surrounding why `typeof(null)` gives \"object\":\r\n[JS Data Types - Null][1]\r\n\r\nHere is the relevant portion (although I would suggest you read the whole post):\r\n\r\nWhy does `typeof null` return `\"object\"`?\r\n`// What's happening here?` >`typeof null === \"object\"; // true`\r\nThe answer might disappoint some, but the truth is simply because the table above says to do so.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind this is that `null`, in contrast with `undefined`, was (and still is) often used where objects appear. In other words, `null` is often used to signify an empty reference to an object. When Brendan Eich created JavaScript, he followed the same paradigm, and it made sense (arguably) to return `\"object\"`. In fact, the ECMAScript specification defines `null` as _the primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value_ (ECMA-262, 11.4.11).\r\n\r\nTo draw a parallel here, consider `typeof(NaN) === \"number\"`. So why does JavaScript give \"number\" as the type of `NaN` (not a number)? It is because `NaN` is used where numbers appear, it is a value that represents the intentional absence of a number value. Similar reasoning applies to `null`, the only difference being that `null` is implemented as a primitive and `NaN` is actually implemented as a `Number` object (so `NaN.foo = 42` would actually work).\r\n\r\n[1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Null\r\n"

As a result, when the line containing the return statement (with nothing else on the line) is encountered in foo2(), a semicolon is automatically inserted immediately after the return statement.\r\n\r\nNo error is thrown since the remainder of the code is perfectly valid, even though it doesn’t ever get invoked or do anything (it is simply an unused code block that defines a property bar which is equal to the string \"hello\").\r\n\r\nThis behavior also argues for following the convention of placing an opening curly brace at the end of a line in JavaScript, rather than on the beginning of a new line.

Therefore\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction display() {\r\n  var a = (b = 10)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nis same as\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction display() {\r\n  var a = (b = 10)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is same as\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction display() {\r\n b = 10;\r\n var a = b;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo b becomes a global variable because there is no var keyword before it and a becomes a local variable. Therefore, outside the function, only b is available so `typeof a === 'undefined'` comes as true and `typeof b === 'undefined'` comes as false.\r\n\r\n![](assets/2020-10-08-17-22-29.png)\r\n\r\nIf we execute the above code in strict mode as shown below,\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"use strict\"\r\nfunction display() {\r\n  var a = (b = 10)\r\n}\r\ndisplay()\r\nconsole.log(\"b\", typeof b === \"undefined\")\r\nconsole.log(\"a\", typeof a === \"undefined\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will throw an error because b becomes a global variable and strict mode does not allow creating global variables so you will get an error when you execute this code.\r\nThat’s it for today.

            "content": "#### Question: What is the value of `Math.max([2,3,4,5]);`\r\n\r\nAnswer: NaN\r\n\r\n#### Explanations\r\n\r\nBecause `max()` is a static method of Math, you always use it as `Math.max()`, rather than as a method of a Math object you created (Math is not a constructor).\r\n\r\nIf no arguments are given, the result is -Infinity.\r\n\r\nIf at least one of arguments cannot be converted to a number, the result is NaN.\r\n\r\nWhen you call Math.max with array parameter like\r\n\r\n```\r\nMath.max([1,2,3])\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou call this function with **one** parameter - `[1,2,3]` and javascript try convert it to number and get (\"1,2,3\" -> _NaN_) fail.\r\nSo result as expected - _NaN_\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** if array with just _one_ number - all work correctly\r\n\r\n     Math.max([23]) // return 23\r\n\r\nbecause `[23] -> \"23\" -> 23` and covert to Number is done.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nIf you want get max element from array you should use [_apply_][2] function, like\r\n\r\n    Math.max.apply(Math,[1,2,3])\r\n\r\nor you can use the [new spread operator][3]\r\n\r\n    Math.max(...[1,2,3])\r\n\r\n[1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max\r\n[2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply\r\n[3]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator\r\n\r\n#### Alternative way to achieve the same above\r\n\r\nThe above `Math.max([2,3,4,5]);` was producing NaN - because I was passing an array as the parameter instead of comma separated numbers. Try spreading the array like this:\r\n\r\ndata = [4, 2, 6, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3];\r\nalert(Math.max(...data));\r\n\r\n#### Further Alternative and more explanations\r\n\r\nThe reason why this is happening is that `Math.max` calculates the maximum out of its parameters. And seen as the first parameter is an Array it returns NaN.\r\n\r\nYou now have **2 options** (depending on your environment or preference):\r\n\r\n### ES6 (with spread syntax)\r\n\r\nYou can spread the array to the params of the function.\r\n\r\n    const thenum = [5, 3, 678, 213];\r\n\r\n    console.log(Math.max(...thenum));\r\n\r\nMore on [the spread syntax][3]\r\n\r\nAnd [here][2] is a jsFiddle with this example.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### ES5 (without spread syntax)\r\n\r\nOr, you can call it using the `apply` method which allows you to call functions and send the parameters for them within an array.\r\n\r\nWhat you want is to apply the `Math.max` function, like so:\r\n\r\n    var thenum = [5, 3, 678, 213];\r\n\r\n    function max(num){\r\n        return Math.max.apply(null, num);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    console.log(max(thenum));\r\n\r\nYou can also make it a method and attach it to the Array prototype. This way you can use it easier and cleaner (**overwriting the prototype is dangerous and you should probably avoid it** - [Read more about it][5]). Like so:\r\n\r\n    Array.prototype.max = function () {\r\n        return Math.max.apply(null, this);\r\n    };\r\n    console.log([5, 3, 678, 213].max());\r\n\r\nMore on [the apply method][1].\r\n\r\nAnd [here][2] is a jsFiddle with both\r\n\r\n[1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply\r\n[2]: https://jsfiddle.net/k7zsbfd3/1/\r\n[3]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax\r\n[4]: https://jsfiddle.net/nikini/3ar64twu/1/\r\n[5]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14034180/why-is-extending-native-objects-a-bad-practice\r\n"

            "content": "Question: Why `.1+.2 != .3`\r\n\r\n**Answer:** This is not a javascript only limitation, it applies to all floating point calculations. The problem is that 0.1 and 0.2 and 0.3 are not exactly representable as javascript (or C or Java etc) floats. Thus the output you are seeing is due to that inaccuracy.\r\n\r\nIn particular only certain sums of powers of two are exactly representable. 0.5 = =0.1b = 2^(-1), 0.25=0.01b=(2^-2), 0.75=0.11b = (2^-1 + 2^-2) are all OK. But 1/10 = 0.000110001100011..b can only be expressed as an infinite sum of powers of 2, which the language chops off at some point. Its this chopping that is causing these slight errors.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Why is 0.1 + 0.2 Not Equal to 0.3 in Most Programming Languages?\r\n\r\nIn decimal, each place to the right of the decimal point is worth one tenth as much as the place to the left of it. So it has a tenths-place, then a hundredths-place, a thousandths-place and so on. Three tenths - which is 0.3 - stores cleanly and nicely in the tenths place.\r\n\r\nIn binary however, each place to the right of the decimal is worth half as much as the place to the left of it. So binary has a halves-place, a quarters-place, an eighths-place, a sixteenths-place, a thirty-seconds place, a sixty-fourths place, etc.\r\n\r\nThe binary floating point format is going to have to store the value as a quarter, plus a thirty-second, and a sixty-fourth, and so on, getting closer and closer to 0.3 - but never actually exactly reaching it.\r\n\r\nSo it stores the closest approximation of 0.3 that it can in the number of bits the variable has available, and that approximation is what you’re seeing when inspecting the value in your program.\r\n\r\nIf you really need to be able to store decimal numbers precisely in a program - eg. financial applications - there are a few options available:\r\n\r\nIf you know the maximum precision you’ll need, you could consider using fixed-point. In fixed point, you use an integer type to store the value, but treat the increment amount as something smaller than 1. For example, you could store a price as an integer in cents, or tenths/hundredths of a cent.\r\n\r\nYou could also use a format called “binary coded decimal”. It uses four bits to store each decimal digit - which is somewhat inefficient, because 16 values can be stored in 4 bits, but BCD only makes use of 10 of those possible values to store 0–9.\r\n\r\nIf precise representation of decimal numbers is what’s really important for your application however, it may still be worth using despite the inefficiency.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##### [VERY DETAILED ANS](https://medium.com/better-programming/why-is-0-1-0-2-not-equal-to-0-3-in-most-programming-languages-99432310d476)\r\n\r\n##### Problem statement: How is it that 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004?\r\n\r\nif you have done programming in languages like Java or C, you must be aware of different data types used to store values. The two data types we would be considering in the discussion ahead are integer and float.\r\n\r\nInteger data types store whole numbers, while float data types store fractional numbers.\r\nBefore we proceed, let’s understand one small concept: How are numbers represented for computational purposes? Very small and very large numbers are usually stored in scientific notation. They are represented as:\r\n\r\n![](assets/2020-10-06-22-02-56.png)\r\n\r\nAlso, a number is normalized when it is written in scientific notation with one nonzero decimal digit before the decimal point. For example, a number 0.0005606 in scientific notation and normalized will be represented as:\r\n\r\n![](assets/2020-10-06-22-03-37.png)\r\n\r\nSignificant is the number of significant digits which do not include zeroes, and base represents the base system used — which is decimal(10) here. Exponent represents the number of places the radix point needs to be moved left or right to be represented correctly.\r\n\r\nNow, there are two ways to display numbers in floating point arithmetic: single precision and double precision. Single precision uses 32 bits, and double precision uses 64 bits for floating-point arithmetic.\r\n\r\nUnlike many other programming languages, JavaScript does not define different types of numeric data types and always stores numbers as double precision floating point numbers, following the international IEEE 754 standard.\r\nThis format stores numbers in 64 bits, where the number (the fraction) is stored in bits 0 to 51, the exponent in bits 52 to 62, and the sign in bit 63.\r\n\r\n![](assets/2020-10-06-22-04-14.png)\r\n\r\nLet’s represent 0.1 in 64 bit following the IEEE754 standard.\r\nThe first step is converting (0.1)base 10 to its binary equivalent (base 2).\r\nTo do so, we will start by multiplying 0.1 by 2 and will separate out the digit before the decimal to get the binary equivalent.\r\n\r\n![](assets/2020-10-06-22-04-39.png)\r\n\r\nOn repeating this for 64 bits, we are going to arrange them in ascending order to get our mantissa, which we are going to round off to 52 bits as per the double precision standard.\r\n\r\n![](assets/2020-10-06-22-04-59.png)\r\n\r\nRepresenting it in scientific form and rounding off to the first 52 bits will yield:\r\n\r\n![](assets/2020-10-06-22-05-14.png)\r\n\r\nThe mantissa part is ready. Now for the exponent we shall use the below calculation:\r\n\r\n![](assets/2020-10-06-22-05-43.png)\r\n\r\n![](assets/2020-10-06-22-06-26.png)\r\n"

Due to references it's wrong to say `[[]][0] === []`, but let's call the inner array `A` to avoid the wrong notation.\r\n\r\n`++` before its operand means “increment by one and return the incremented result”. So `++[[]][0]` is equivalent to `Number(A) + 1` (or `+A + 1`).\r\n\r\nAgain, we can simplify the mess into something more legible. Let's substitute `[]` back for `A`:\r\n\r\n    (+[] + 1)\r\n    +\r\n    [0]\r\n\r\nBefore `+[]` can coerce the array into the number `0`, it needs to be coerced into a string first, which is `\"\"`, again. Finally, `1` is added, which results in `1`.\r\n\r\n- `(+[] + 1) === (+\"\" + 1)`\r\n- `(+\"\" + 1) === (0 + 1)`\r\n- `(0 + 1) === 1`\r\n\r\nLet's simplify it even more:\r\n\r\n    1\r\n    +\r\n    [0]\r\n\r\nAlso, this is true in JavaScript: `[0] == \"0\"`, because it's joining an array with one element. Joining will concatenate the elements separated by `,`. With one element, you can deduce that this logic will result in the first element itself.\r\n\r\nIn this case, `+` sees two operands: a number and an array. It’s now trying to coerce the two into the same type. First, the array is coerced into the string `\"0\"`, next, the number is coerced into a string (`\"1\"`). _Number `+` String `===` String_.\r\n\r\n    \"1\" + \"0\" === \"10\" // Yay!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSpecification details for `+[]`:\r\n\r\nThis is quite a maze, but to do `+[]`, first it is being converted to a string because that's what `+` says:\r\n\r\n11.4.6 Unary + Operator\r\nThe unary + operator converts its operand to Number type.\r\nThe production UnaryExpression : + UnaryExpression is evaluated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Let expr be the result of evaluating UnaryExpression.\r\n2. Return ToNumber(GetValue(expr)).\r\n\r\n`ToNumber()` says:\r\n\r\nObject\r\n\r\nApply the following steps:\r\n\r\n1.  Let primValue be ToPrimitive(input argument, hint String).\r\n\r\n2.  Return ToString(primValue).\r\n\r\n`ToPrimitive()` says:\r\n\r\nObject\r\nReturn a default value for the Object. The default value of an object is retrieved by calling the [[DefaultValue]] internal method of the object, passing the optional hint PreferredType. The behaviour of the [[DefaultValue]] internal method is defined by this specification for all native ECMAScript objects in 8.12.8.\r\n\r\n`[[DefaultValue]]` says:\r\n\r\n8.12.8 [[DefaultValue]](hint)\r\nWhen the [[DefaultValue]] internal method of O is called with hint String, the following steps are taken:\r\n\r\n1. Let toString be the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of object O with argument \"toString\".\r\n2. If IsCallable(toString) is true then,\r\n   a. Let str be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of toString, with O as the this value and an empty argument list.\r\n   b. If str is a primitive value, return str.\r\n\r\nThe `.toString` of an array says:\r\n\r\n15.4.4.2 Array.prototype.toString ( )\r\nWhen the toString method is called, the following steps are taken:\r\n\r\n1. Let array be the result of calling ToObject on the this value.\r\n\r\n2. Let func be the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of array with argument \"join\".\r\n\r\n3. If IsCallable(func) is false, then let func be the standard built-in method Object.prototype.toString (15.2.4.2).\r\n\r\n4. Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of func providing array as the this value and an empty arguments list.\r\n\r\nSo `+[]` comes down to `+\"\"`, because `[].join() === \"\"`.\r\n\r\nAgain, the `+` is defined as:\r\n\r\n11.4.6 Unary + Operator\r\n\r\nThe unary + operator converts its operand to Number type.\r\nThe production UnaryExpression : + UnaryExpression is evaluated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Let expr be the result of evaluating UnaryExpression.\r\n2. Return ToNumber(GetValue(expr)).\r\n\r\n`ToNumber` is defined for `\"\"` as:\r\n\r\nThe MV of StringNumericLiteral ::: [empty] is 0.\r\n\r\nSo `+\"\" === 0`, and thus `+[] === 0`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Explanation-2\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    ++[[]][+[]] => 1 // [+[]] = [0], ++0 = 1\r\n    [+[]] => [0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we have a string concatenation\r\n\r\n```js\r\n1 + [0].toString() = 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Explanation-3\r\n\r\n+[] evaluates to 0 [...] then summing (+ operation) it with anything converts array content to its string representation consisting of elements joined with comma.\r\n\r\nAnything other like taking index of array (have grater priority than + operation) is ordinal and is nothing interesting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Explanation-4\r\n\r\nThe following is adapted from a [blog post][1] answering this question that I posted while this question was still closed. Links are to (an HTML copy of) the ECMAScript 3 spec, still the baseline for JavaScript in today's commonly used web browsers.\r\n\r\nFirst, a comment: this kind of expression is never going to show up in any (sane) production environment and is only of any use as an exercise in just how well the reader knows the dirty edges of JavaScript. The general principle that JavaScript operators implicitly convert between types is useful, as are some of the common conversions, but much of the detail in this case is not.\r\n\r\nThe expression `++[[]][+[]]+[+[]]` may initially look rather imposing and obscure, but is actually relatively easy break down into separate expressions. Below I’ve simply added parentheses for clarity; I can assure you they change nothing, but if you want to verify that then feel free to read up about the [grouping operator][2]. So, the expression can be more clearly written as\r\n\r\n    ( ++[[]][+[]] ) + ( [+[]] )\r\n\r\nBreaking this down, we can simplify by observing that `+[]` evaluates to `0`. To satisfy yourself why this is true, check out the [unary + operator][3] and follow the slightly tortuous trail which ends up with [ToPrimitive][4] converting the empty array into an empty string, which is then finally converted to `0` by [ToNumber][5]. We can now substitute `0` for each instance of `+[]`:\r\n\r\n    ( ++[[]][0] ) + [0]\r\n\r\nSimpler already. As for `++[[]][0]`, that’s a combination of the [prefix increment operator][6] (`++`), an [array literal][7] defining an array with single element that is itself an empty array (`[[]]`) and a [property accessor][8] (`[0]`) called on the array defined by the array literal.\r\n\r\nSo, we can simplify `[[]][0]` to just `[]` and we have `++[]`, right? In fact, this is not the case because evaluating `++[]` throws an error, which may initially seem confusing. However, a little thought about the nature of `++` makes this clear: it’s used to increment a variable (e.g. `++i`) or an object property (e.g. `++obj.count`). Not only does it evaluate to a value, it also stores that value somewhere. In the case of `++[]`, it has nowhere to put the new value (whatever it may be) because there is no reference to an object property or variable to update. In spec terms, this is covered by the internal [PutValue][9] operation, which is called by the prefix increment operator.\r\n\r\nSo then, what does `++[[]][0]` do? Well, by similar logic as `+[]`, the inner array is converted to `0` and this value is incremented by `1` to give us a final value of `1`. The value of property `0` in the outer array is updated to `1` and the whole expression evaluates to `1`.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with\r\n\r\n    1 + [0]\r\n\r\n... which is a simple use of the [addition operator][10]. Both operands are first [converted to primitives][11] and if either primitive value is a string, string concatenation is performed, otherwise numeric addition is performed. `[0]` converts to `\"0\"`, so string concatenation is used, producing `\"10\"`.\r\n\r\nAs a final aside, something that may not be immediately apparent is that overriding either one of the `toString()` or `valueOf()` methods of `Array.prototype` will change the result of the expression, because both are checked and used if present when converting an object into a primitive value. For example, the following\r\n\r\n    Array.prototype.toString = function() {\r\n      return \"foo\";\r\n    };\r\n    ++[[]][+[]]+[+[]]\r\n\r\n... produces `\"NaNfoo\"`. Why this happens is left as an exercise for the reader...\r\n\r\n[1]: http://tmik.co.uk/?p=672\r\n[2]: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.1.6\r\n[3]: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.4.6\r\n[4]: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-9.1\r\n[5]: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-9.3\r\n[6]: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.4.4\r\n[7]: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.1.4\r\n[8]: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.2.1\r\n[9]: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-8.7.2\r\n[10]: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.6.1\r\n[11]: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-9.1\r\n"

Else, if I just return a console.log from that function, then it would get normally logged-out.\r\n\r\nNote the arrangement of the functions as the stack begins with the firstFunction() (which is the last function that got into the stack, but got executed the first. And is popped out to throw the error. Then followed by the secondFunction(), and then the thirdFunction() (which is the first function that gets pushed into the stack when the code is executed.\r\n\r\nTemporarily store: When a function is invoked (called), the function, its parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame. This stack frame is a memory location in the stack. The memory is cleared when the function returns as it is pop out of the stack.\r\n\r\nManage function invocation (call): The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous. Now look at the below code\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction firstFunction() {\r\n    console.log(\"hello from firstFunction\")\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction secondFunction() {\r\n    firstFunction();\r\n    console.log(\"The end from secondFunction\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction thirdFunction() {\r\n    secondFunction();\r\n    console.log(\"The end from thirdFunction\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nthirdFunction()\r\n```\r\n```\r\nOUPUT\r\nfirstFunction\r\nThe end from secondFunction\r\nThe end from thirdFunction\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what happens when the code is run:\r\n\r\n1. When thirdFunction() gets executed, an empty stack frame is created. It is the main (anonymous) entry point of the program.\r\n\r\n2. thirdFunction() then calls secondFunction() which is pushed into the stack.\r\n\r\n3. secondFunction() then calls firstFunction() which is pushed into the stack.\r\n\r\n4. firstFunction() returns and prints “Hello from firstFunction” to the console.\r\n\r\n5. firstFunction() is popped off the stack.\r\n\r\n6. The execution order then move to secondFunction().\r\n\r\n7. secondFunction() returns and print “The end from secondFunction” to the console.\r\n\r\n8. The execution order then move to thirdFunction().\r\n\r\n9.  thirdFunction() returns and print “The end from thirdFunction” to the console.\r\n\r\n### What causes a stack overflow?\r\n\r\nA stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction callMyself(){\r\n  callMyself();\r\n}\r\ncallMyself();\r\n```\r\nThe callMyself() will run until the browser throws a “Maximum call size exceeded”. And that is a stack overflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The key takeaways from the call stack are:\r\n\r\n1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.\r\n2. Code execution is synchronous.\r\n3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.\r\n4. It works as a LIFO — Last In, First Out data structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But what happens when you need two different data types to interact with one another? Say, when you try to add a string to a number? This is where type coercion comes into play. Type coercion is a way of changing a value from one data type into another data type so that it can adopt the other’s behavior.\r\n\r\nCoercion comes in two forms: implicit; and, explicit. In the former, the interpreter looks at an expression that uses two different data types and uses a set of internal rules to decide whether one or both of the values should be coerced so that they have matching rules. In the latter, the source code explicitly instructs the interpreter on how it should handle coercion rather than letting it rely on its internal rules. As is so often the case, this is easiest to observe in code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Implicit\r\nconsole.log(\"20\" + 18);                   // Logs: 2018\r\n// The number 18 is implicitly coerced into a string so that it can be concatenated onto the string “20”.\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"20\" * 18);                   // Logs: 360\r\n//  The string “20” is implicitly coerced into a number so that it can be multiplied by the number 18.\r\n\r\nconsole.log(20 + true);                   // Logs: 21\r\n// The boolean true is implicitly coerced into a number (1) so that it can be added to the number 20.\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"20\" == 20);                  // Logs: true\r\n// The string “20” is implicitly coerced into a number so that it can be tested by loose equality against the number 20.\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"20\" === 20);                 // Logs: false\r\n// No coercion takes place when the strict equality operator is used.\r\n\r\n// Explicit\r\nconsole.log(Number(\"20\") + 18);           // Logs: 38\r\n// The string “20” is explicitly coerced into a number and added to the number 18 (giving us a different result than the implicit coercion version of this expression on line 2).\r\n\r\nconsole.log(String(20) + String(true));   // Logs: \"20true\"\r\n// The number 20 and the boolean true are explicitly coerced into strings and concatenated (giving us a different result than the implicit coercion version of this expression on line 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```"

Are the variables declared inside of it accessible outside of it? Turns out, they are.\r\nsince variables declared with var are function scoped\r\n\r\nNow do the same function with let\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction discountPrices(prices, discount) {\r\n  let discounted = []\r\n\r\n  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {\r\n    let discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)\r\n    let finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100\r\n    discounted.push(finalPrice)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  console.log(i) // ReferenceError: i is not defined\r\n  console.log(discountedPrice)\r\n  console.log(finalPrice)\r\n\r\n  return discounted\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiscountPrices([100, 200, 300], 0.5) // ReferenceError: i is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe get ReferenceError: i is not defined. What this tells us is that variables declared with let are block scoped, not function scoped. So trying to access i (or discountedPrice or finalPrice) outside of the “block” they were declared in is going to give us a reference error as we just barely saw.\r\n\r\n### const - In constants mutation is allowed but reassignment is not allowed.\r\n\r\nconst person = {\r\nname: 'Kim Kardashian'\r\n}\r\n\r\nperson.name = 'Kim Kardashian West' // ✅\r\n\r\nperson = {} // ❌ Assignment to constant variable.\r\n\r\nNotice that changing a property on an object isn’t reassigning it, so even though an object is declared with const, that doesn’t mean you can’t mutate any of its properties. It only means you can’t reassign it to a new value.\r\n\r\n#### Very Important - There is another great advantage using let as it creates a new lexical environment and also binds fresh value rather than keeping an old reference.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfor (var i = 1; i < 6; i++) {\r\n  setTimeout(function() {\r\n    console.log(i)\r\n  }, 1000)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Now the same with 'let'\r\n\r\nfor (let i = 1; i < 6; i++) {\r\n  setTimeout(function() {\r\n    console.log(i)\r\n  }, 1000)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first for loop will print the last value 5 times, with let it creates a new scope and bind fresh values printing us 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\r\n\r\n### Difference between Object.freeze() and const\r\n\r\n**const** and **Object.freeze** are two completely different things.\r\n\r\nconst applies to bindings (\"variables\"). It creates an immutable binding, i.e. you cannot assign a new value to the binding.\r\n\r\nObject.freeze works on values, and more specifically, object values. Object.freeze() is a method which accepts an object and returns the same object. Now the object cannot have any of its properties removed or any new properties added. It makes an object immutable, i.e. you cannot change its properties.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand if I use const to declare and object, it doesn't \"freeze\" them, you just can't redeclare the whole object, but you can modify its keys freely. On the other hand you can redeclare frozen objects.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst obj = {\r\n  name: \"rohan\",\r\n}\r\n\r\nobj.name = \"paul\"\r\n\r\nconsole.log(obj)\r\n```\r\n"

        "content": "## How does event delegation work?\r\n\r\nEvent delegation makes use of two features of JavaScript events: event bubbling and the target element. When an event is triggered on an element, for example a mouse click on a button, the same event is also triggered on all of that element’s ancestors. This process is known as event bubbling. So in other words, When an event is fired from an element, the event will be bubbled up to its parent nodes.\r\n\r\nThe event bubbles up from the originating element to the top of the DOM tree. The target element of any event is the originating element, the button in our example, and is stored in a property of the event object. The 'target', stays the same in the event object. Using event delegation it’s possible to add an event handler to an element, wait for an event to bubble up from a child element and easily determine from which element the event originated.\r\n\r\nUsing the target property, we can always keep track which element actually causes an event captured by its parent, and it can help us reduce the number of event handlers as we sometimes don't need to add event listeners for every element.\r\n\r\n## What is the Event Propagation?\r\n\r\nLet’s start with event propagation. This is the blanket term for both event bubbling and event capturing. Consider the typical markup to build a list of linked images, for a thumbnails gallery for example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"...\"><img src=\"...\" alt=\"\"></a>\r\n    <li><a href=\"...\"><img src=\"...\" alt=\"\"></a>\r\n    ...\r\n    <li><a href=\"...\"><img src=\"...\" alt=\"\"></a>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nA click on an image does not only generate a click event for the corresponding IMG element, but also for the parent A, for the grandfather LI and so on, going all the way up through all the element’s ancestors, before terminating at the window object.\r\n\r\nIn DOM terminology, the image is the event target, the innermost element over which the click originated. The event target, plus its ancestors, from its parent up through to the window object, form a branch in the DOM tree. For example, in the image gallery, this branch will be composed of the nodes: IMG, A, LI, UL, BODY, HTML, document, window.\r\n\r\nNote that window is not actually a DOM node but it implements the EventTarget interface, so, for simplicity, we are handling it like it was the parent node of the document object.\r\n\r\nThis branch is important because it is the path along which the events propagate (or flow). This propagation is the process of calling all the listeners for the given event type, attached to the nodes on the branch. Each listener will be called with an event object that gathers information relevant to the event\r\n\r\nRemember that several listeners can be registered on a node for the same event type. When the propagation reaches one such node, listeners are invoked in the order of their registration.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that the branch determination is static, that is, it is established at the initial dispatch of the event. Tree modifications occurring during event processing will be ignored.\r\n\r\nThe propagation is bidirectional, from the window to the event target and back. This propagation can be divided into three phases:\r\n\r\nFrom the window to the event target parent: this is the capture phase\r\nThe event target itself: this is the target phase\r\nFrom the event target parent back to the window: the bubble phase\r\n\r\n## How will it help me?\r\n\r\nImagine an HTML table with 10 columns and 100 rows in which you want something to happen when the user clicks on a table cell. For example, I once had to make each cell of a table of that size editable when clicked. Adding event handlers to each of the 1000 cells would be a major performance problem and, potentially, a source of browser-crashing memory leaks. Instead, using event delegation, you would add only one event handler to the table element, intercept the click event and determine which cell was clicked.\r\n\r\n### More Resources to read\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sitepoint.com/event-bubbling-javascript/\r\n"

There can only ever be 1 global context, which can be accessed from any other context in your program.\r\n\r\n### You can have any number of function contexts, and each function call creates a new context, which creates a private scope where anything declared inside of the function can not be directly accessed from outside the current function scope. In the example above, a function can access a variable declared outside of its current context, but an outside context can not access the variables / functions declared inside. Why does this happen? How exactly is this code evaluated?\r\n\r\n### As we already know, when a browser first loads your script, it enters the global execution context by default. If, in your global code you call a function, the sequence flow of your program enters the function being called, creating a new execution context and pushing that context to the top of the execution stack.\r\n\r\n### If you call another function inside this current function, the same thing happens. The execution flow of code enters the inner function, which creates a new execution context that is pushed to the top of the existing stack. The browser will always execute the current execution context that sits on top of the stack, and once the function completes executing the current execution context, it will be popped off the top of the stack, returning control to the context below in the current stack.\r\n\r\n## Scope is literally that: the scope in which a variable can be accessed. Simplistically:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar x\r\n\r\nfunction a() {\r\n  var y\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nx can be accessed from anywhere. When a is invoked, x will be in the outer scope. (Stored in the scope chain.)\r\n\r\nIn contrast, y can only be accessed by code in a() because it is limited to a's scope. This is what the var keyword does: restricts a variable to the local scope. If we omitted var, y would end up in the global scope, generally considered a bad thing.\r\n"

The idea is that you transfer encrypted information, and the receiever can then decrypt it and read the contents.\r\n\r\n## Hashing is one way, can't be undone\r\n\r\nThe concept between hashing is that it can't be undone. It is a one way operation, and there is no way to go from the hash to the original contents. While this may seem more secure, it does obviously come with a cost.\r\n\r\nIf passing over hashed data, there is no way for the recipient to go back from the hashed data to the original data. This means the use case is a little more limited. Since the process of hashing is unique (given an input, always produces the same output & doesn't produce the same output for two different inputs) it means we can compare if indeed the same input is submitted again at a later date (like a password submissions?) but we can't identify what the password is."

Provide some examples where it can be good or bad.\r\n\r\nAn Execution Context is created each time you run your .js file/app. The first step in this creation phase is Hoisting. The JS Engine reserves space or set's up memory for all the variables and functions defined in your code. These are then accessed when your code is executed line-by-line.\r\n\r\nFunction (and also variable) hoisting is when a function (or variable) is available before it's actual declaration statement.\r\nConsider the following code.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// returns a is not defined - reference error\r\nconsole.log(a)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// returns undefined\r\nconsole.log(a)\r\nvar a = \"hello\"\r\nconsole.log(a)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes 'var a' is hoisted to the top of the file. There's it is not declared yet, and so remains undefined, but no longer has a reference error.\r\n\r\n### Hoisting for Function Declaration\r\n\r\n### Similarly, if a function is declared via functional declaration (using the keyword function) it is hoisted to the top.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(foo()) // => 9\r\nfunction foo() {\r\n  return 9\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever This does not work for function expressions (assigning to a variable)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// returns foo is not a function\r\nconsole.log(foo())\r\nvar foo = function() {\r\n  return 9\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the above reason, the below will ouput \"this hoistedFunc will work\" - Because the\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// run a for loop that will only run for 1 iteration\r\nfor (let n = 0; n < 1; n++) {\r\n  hoistedFunc()\r\n\r\n  var hoistedFunc = function() {\r\n    console.log(\"this hoistedFunc with function expression will NOT work\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction hoistedFunc() {\r\n  console.log(\"this hoistedFunc will work\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile the example is rather benign, it is easy to see how this may result in an ongoing error which is not detected\r\n\r\n## Think of hoisting as more of a compile-time thing. In JavaScript, function declarations are \"hoisted\" to the top of their scope. In other words, they are parsed and evaluated before any other code. (This is opposed to function expressions, which are evaluated inline.) Consider the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\na() // => Hello\r\n\r\nb() // => TypeError: b is not a function\r\n\r\nfunction a() {\r\n  console.log(\"Hello\")\r\n}\r\nvar b = function() {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe call to a() will succeed because its declaration was hoisted to the top; a was assigned to automatically before program execution began.\r\n\r\nFor the call to b() - the b variable declaration will also be hoisted: it'll be declared from the start, but no value will be assigned to it before line 4. Calling b() before line 4 will indeed result in an error, but a different one: we'll be trying to execute undefined, which isn't a function.\r\n\r\n### Why let is NOT hoisted\r\n\r\n#### First lets understand Under the hood: variables lifecycle\r\n\r\nWhen the engine works with variables, their lifecycle consists of the following phases:\r\n\r\nDeclaration phase - is registering a variable in the scope.\r\n\r\nInitialization phase - is allocating memory and creating a binding for the variable in the scope. At this step the variable is automatically initialized with undefined.\r\nAssignment phase - is assigning a value to the initialized variable.\r\n\r\n**A variable has unitialized state when it passed the declaration phase, yet didn’t reach the initilization.**\r\n\r\nvar variables lifecycle - **The variable passes the declaration phase and right away the initialization phase at the beginning of the scope, before any statements are executed (step 1). var variable statement position in the function scope does not influence the declaration and initialization phases.**\r\n\r\n**let variables are processed differently than var. The main distinction is that declaration and initialization phases are split.**\r\n\r\nNow let’s study a scenario when the interpreter enters a block scope that contains a let variable statement. Immediately the variable passes the declaration phase, registering its name in the scope (step 1).\r\nThen interpreter continues parsing the block statements line by line.\r\n\r\nIf you try to access variable at this stage, JavaScript will throw ReferenceError: variable is not defined. It happens because the variable state is uninitialized.\r\nvariable is in the **temporal dead zon**e.\r\n\r\nWhen interpreter reaches the statement let variable, the initilization phase is passed (step 2). Now the variable state is initialized and accessing it evaluates to undefined. The variable exits the temporal dead zone.\r\n\r\nLater when an assignment statement appears variable = 'value', the assignment phase is passed (step 3).\r\n\r\nQuoting ECMAScript 6 (ECMAScript 2015) specification's, let and const declarations section,\r\n\r\nThe variables are created when their containing Lexical Environment is instantiated but may not be accessed in any way until the variable’s LexicalBinding is evaluated.\r\n\r\nSo, to answer your question, yes, let and const hoist but you cannot access them before the actual declaration is evaluated at runtime.\r\n"

Is it strong or weak type?\r\n\r\nTLDR answer - Javascript is dynamic and weakly typed.\r\n\r\n## Static vs Dynamic\r\n\r\nA statically typed language is one in which the types are checked are compile time. This is opposed to dynamically typed languages where type is checked as run time. Additionally, most staticly typed languages require you to declare the type as part of the variable declaration process.\r\n\r\n## Strong vs weak\r\n\r\nRelated to static vs dynamic, strong vs weak relates to if a pointer can be reassigned to a value of a different type. In the case of Javascript, this is possible. We are able to do something like below.\r\n\r\n```Javascript\r\nvar a = \"string\"\r\na = 3 // this is allowed\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [type coercion](what-is-type-coercion.md) can occured because Javascript is weakly typed.

You can, of course, coerce/stringify other data types into strings, but this adds extra work.\r\n\r\n### Downside #2: Objects are not inherently iterable\r\n\r\nObjects weren’t designed to be used as collections, and as a result there’s no efficient way to determine how many properties an object has. (See, for example, Object.keys is slow). When you loop over an object’s properties, you also get its prototype properties. You could add the iterable property to all objects, but not all objects are meant to be used as collections. You could use the for … in loop and the hasOwnProperty() method, but this is just a workaround. When you loop over an object’s properties, the properties won’t necessarily be retrieved in the same order they were inserted.\r\n\r\n### Downside #3: Challenges with built-in method collisions\r\n\r\nObjects have built-in methods like constructor, toString, and valueOf. If one of these was added as a property, it could cause collisions. You could use Object.create(null) to create a bare object (which doesn’t inherit from object.prototype), but, again, this is just a workaround.\r\n\r\nES6 includes new collection data types, so there’s no longer a need to use objects and live with their drawbacks."

Class inheritance may or may not use the `class` keyword from ES6.\r\n\r\nPrototypal Inheritance: instances inherit directly from other objects. Instances are typically instantiated via factory functions or `Object.create()`. Instances may be composed from many different objects, allowing for easy selective inheritance."

Reflow and repaint are important concepts that most developers are not exposed to.\r\n\r\nPut simply, browser reflow is simply the process of re-calculating the positions of elements on a page. When you change a div's height, or the font, or set a property using the style attribute, the browser has to recalculate in order to re-render\r\nthe webpage.\r\n\r\nWhat typically triggers reflow:\r\n\r\n- Resizing the window\r\n- Changing the font\r\n- Changing the font size\r\n- Animations of DOM elements\r\n- Adding/removing a stylesheet\r\n- Calculating offsetWidth or offsetHeight\r\n\r\nReflow is an expensive process and should be avoided. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHxbs5WEQzE) to watch an awesome video on how to minimize browser reflow.\r\n\r\nSo what about repaint? Repaint happens when you change the element's apperance without any major changes. So that includes changing the color, background color, the border color or setting the\r\n`visibility:hidden`.\r\n\r\nFrom a performance standpoint, repaint is less expensive than reflow.\r\n\r\nFor better understanding go to this link (https://gist.github.com/faressoft/36cdd64faae21ed22948b458e6bf04d5) \r\n"

Creating a new object with the same internals as another object will not magically cause that object to point to one that already exists. The objects may look the same, but they do not point to the same instance.\r\n\r\nNon-Primitive data-types like Objects are not compared by value. This means that even if two objects have the same properties and values, they are not strictly equal. Same goes for arrays. Even if they have the same elements that are in the same order, they are not strictly equal.\r\n\r\nNon primitive values can also be referred to as reference types because they are being compared by reference instead of value. Two objects are only strictly equal if they refer to the same underlying object.\r\n\r\n */\r\n\r\n// To understand better of the concept of 'pass-by-value' vs 'pass-by-reference'\r\n// https://codeburst.io/javascript-passing-by-value-vs-reference-explained-in-plain-english-8d00fd06a47c\r\n// The below example is one of pass-by-value\r\nlet a = 5\r\nlet b = a\r\n\r\nconsole.log(a) // => 5\r\nconsole.log(b) // => 5\r\n\r\na = 1\r\n\r\nconsole.log(a) // => 1\r\nconsole.log(b) // => 5\r\n\r\n/*\r\n1. Pass-by-Value\r\nWhen assigning a variable (a) a primitive value the equals operator sets up a location (address) in memory to store the information and points the variable (a) to that address. When you create a new variable (b in this case) and assign it the value of another variable (a) the equals operator creates ANOTHER spot in memory separate from the original variable and places of copy of (a) in the new variables spot in memory. So, 'pass-by-value' copies the value of the original variable (a) into two separate spots in memory.\r\n\r\nIn the above we assign variable (a) the value of 5. The equals operator notices the value is a primitive and creates a new location in memory, points (a) to the address, and fills it with the value 5. When we create variable (b) and assign it the value of (a) the equals operator notices we’re dealing with a primitive value (5 in this case) and creates a NEW location in memory, points (b) to the NEW address, and fills it with a copy of (a)’s value (5). The console.log() of each variable prints what we would expect (5) at this point. However, when we change the value of (a) to 1 and console.log both variables (a) prints 1 as expected, but (b) is still equal to 5. Why? Because as discussed earlier when we assigned (b) to equal (a) a new location in memory was created, the equals operator did not simply have (b) point to the same spot in memory that (a) does, (b) was given its own location filled with the value of (a) at that time (5). So when (a) was changed (b) does not follow suit because it’s pointing to it’s OWN spot in memory, it has no idea that (a)’s value has changed since that is an entirely separate address in memory.\r\n */\r\n\r\n// Now pass-by-reference\r\nlet c = { language: \"Javascript\" }\r\nlet d = c\r\n\r\nconsole.log(c) // => {language: \"Javascript\"}\r\nconsole.log(d) // => {language: \"Javascript\"}\r\n\r\n// Let's mutate our object 'd'\r\nd.language = \"Ruby\"\r\n\r\nconsole.log(c) // => {language: \"Ruby\"}\r\nconsole.log(d) // => {language: \"Ruby\"}\r\n\r\n// Meaning mutating the object d also mutates the object c - Because 'd' points to the same reference-location as 'c' .\r\n// So when I do d.language = 'Ruby' that instruction hits the same memory location which 'c' is referring to .\r\n\r\n/*\r\n 2. Pass-By-Reference\r\n\r\nExplanation - A. Passing by reference relates to objects in Javascript (ALL objects including functions).\r\n\r\nWhen a variable (a) is set equal to an object the equals operator identifies that the value is an object, creates a new location in memory, and points (a) to the address (represented by 0x001). When we create a new variable (b) and assign it the value of variable (a) the equals operator knows we are dealing with an object and points it to the same address that (a) points to.\r\n\r\nNotice that NO new location or object in memory is created (like in pass by value), rather variable (b) is simply pointed to the same address that variable (a) was pointed to.\r\n\r\nIn sum, ALL objects interact by reference in Javascript so when setting equal to each other or passing to a function they all point to the same location so when you change one object you change them all. This is a stark difference compared to pass by value.\r\n\r\nExplanation - B. Think of it like this:\r\n\r\nWhenever you create an object in ECMAscript, this object is formed in a mystique ECMAscript universal place where no man will ever be able to get. All you get back is a reference to that object in this mystique place.\r\n\r\nvar obj = { };\r\n\r\nEven obj is only a reference to the object (which is located in that special wonderful place) and hence, you can only pass this reference around. Effectively, any piece of code which accesses obj will modify the object which is far, far away.\r\n\r\nExplanation - C\r\n\r\nJavaScript is pass by value. For primitives, primitive's value is passed. For Objects, Object's reference \"value\" is passed. So when I say, objects are passed by reference > That reference is itself passed by value >\r\n\r\nSo now the question is -  what is the value of the reference? - A \"reference\" means something like what \"pointer\" means in C or C++ (well C++ has both pointers and references). However in languages like JavaScript or Java for that matter a \"value\" that is a particular object can only be a reference to the object.\r\n\r\n*/\r\n"

        "content": "#### Describe the functionality of the use strict; directive\r\n\r\nthe `use strict` directive defines that the Javascript should be executed in `strict mode`.\r\nOne major benefit that strict mode provides is that it prevents developers from using\r\nundeclared variables. Older versions of javascript would ignore this directive declaration\r\n\r\n💡 It's best practice to be more strict instead of failing silently.\r\n\r\n- **Makes debugging easier** : Code errors that would otherwise have been ignored or would have failed silently will now generate errors or throw exceptions, alerting you sooner to problems in your code and directing you more quickly to their source.\r\n- **Prevents accidental globals** : Without strict mode, assigning a value to an undeclared variable automatically creates a global variable with that name. This is one of the most common errors in JavaScript. In strict mode, attempting to do so throws an error.\r\n- **Eliminates `this` coercion** : Without strict mode, a reference to a this value of null or undefined is automatically coerced to the global. This can cause many headfakes and pull-out-your-hair kind of bugs. In strict mode, referencing a `this` value of null or undefined throws an error.\r\n- **Disallows duplicate property names or parameter values** : Strict mode throws an error when it detects a duplicate named property in an object (e.g., `var object = {foo: \"bar\", foo: \"baz\"};`) or a duplicate named argument for a function (e.g., `function foo(val1, val2, val1){}`), thereby catching what is almost certainly a bug in your code that you might otherwise have wasted lots of time tracking down.\r\n- **Makes eval() safer** : There are some differences in the way `eval()` behaves in strict mode and in non-strict mode. Most significantly, in strict mode, variables and functions declared inside of an eval() statement are not created in the containing scope (they are created in the containing scope in non-strict mode, which can also be a common source of problems).\r\n- **Throws error on invalid usage of delete** : The `delete` operator (used to remove properties from objects) cannot be used on non-configurable properties of the object. Non-strict code will fail silently when an attempt is made to delete a non-configurable property, whereas strict mode will throw an error in such a case.\r\n"

These are called a click event or a keypress event, respectively.\r\n\r\nAn event handler is a JavaScript function that runs when an event fires.\r\n\r\nAn event listener attaches a responsive interface to an element, which allows that particular element to wait and “listen” for the given event to fire.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways to assign events to elements:\r\n\r\n- Inline event handlers\r\n- Event handler properties\r\n- Event listeners\r\n\r\n### How events work\r\n\r\nWhen events happen to an HTML element in a web page, it checks to see if any event handlers are attached to it. If the answer is yes, it calls them in respective order, while sending along references and further information for each event that occurred. The event handlers then act upon the event.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of event order: event capturing and event bubbling.\r\n\r\nEvent capturing starts with the outer most element in the DOM and works inwards to the HTML element the event took place on and then out again. For example, a click in a web page would first check the HTML element for onclick event handlers, then the body element, and so on, until it reaches the target of the event.\r\n\r\nEvent bubbling works in exactly the opposite manner: it begins by checking the target of the event for any attached event handlers, then bubbles up through each respective parent element until it reaches the HTML element.\r\n"

        "content": "#### What are aggregations?\r\n\r\nAggregation in MongoDB is nothing but an operation used to process the data that returns the computed results. Aggregation basically groups the data from multiple documents and operates in many ways on those grouped data in order to return one combined result.\r\n\r\nAggregation process documents and return computed results. Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together, and can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single result.\r\nAggregations can be used to apply a sequence of query-operations to the documents in a collection, reducing and transforming them. With aggregations, we can perform queries that offer similar functionality to the behaviors we might expect to see in a relational database query.\r\n\r\nIn Mongo, aggregations work as a pipeline, or a list of operators/filters applied to the data. Operators come in three varieties: stages, expressions, and accumulators. When calling aggregate on a collection, we pass a list of stage operators. Documents are processed through the stages in sequence, with each stage applying to each document individually.\r\n\r\n#### Different expressions used by Aggregate function\r\n\r\n| Expression | Description                                                            |\r\n| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| \\$sum      | Summates the defined values from all the documents in a collection     |\r\n| \\$avg      | Calculates the average values from all the documents in a collection   |\r\n| \\$min      | Return the minimum of all values of documents in a collection          |\r\n| \\$max      | Return the maximum of all values of documents in a collection          |\r\n| \\$addToSet | Inserts values to an array but no duplicates in the resulting document |\r\n| \\$push     | Inserts values to an array in the resulting document                   |\r\n| \\$first    | Returns the first document from the source document                    |\r\n| \\$last     | Returns the last document from the source document                     |\r\n\r\nA> The best explanation is given in the [official dox](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/aggregation/)\r\n\r\nB> The signature of the db.collection.aggregate() - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.aggregate/\r\n\r\nC> The project function and the various pipeline stages (project being one of the stages) - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/project/\r\n\r\n#### \\$match (where)\r\n\r\n$match is a stage operator with this definition: { $match: { <query> } }\r\n\r\nThe syntax for query is identical read operation query syntax. Ideally, you will use \\$match as early in the pipeline as possible:\r\n\r\nBecause $match limits the total number of documents in the aggregation pipeline, earlier $match operations minimize the amount of processing down the pipe.\r\nIn effect, with \\$match Mongo will filter the collection accoring to the query parameters, and only pass through the documents matching the query, to the next stage of the pipeline. Take this example of “article” documents in a collection, with an author — and then filtering by the name of the author:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Given these documents in a collection\r\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"512bc95fe835e68f199c8686\"), \"author\" : \"dave\", \"score\" : 80 }\r\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"512bc962e835e68f199c8687\"), \"author\" : \"dave\", \"score\" : 85  }\r\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"55f5a192d4bede9ac365b257\"), \"author\" : \"ahn\", \"score\" : 60 }\r\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"55f5a192d4bede9ac365b258\"), \"author\" : \"li\", \"score\" : 55 }\r\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"55f5a1d3d4bede9ac365b259\"), \"author\" : \"annT\", \"score\" : 60 }\r\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"55f5a1d3d4bede9ac365b25a\"), \"author\" : \"li\", \"score\" : 94 }\r\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"55f5a1d3d4bede9ac365b25b\"), \"author\" : \"ty\", \"score\" : 95 }\r\n\r\n// Apply this aggregation\r\ndb.articles.aggregate(\r\n    [ { $match : { author : \"dave\" } } ]\r\n);\r\n\r\n// Which returns these documents\r\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"512bc95fe835e68f199c8686\"), \"author\" : \"dave\", \"score\" : 80 }\r\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"512bc962e835e68f199c8687\"), \"author\" : \"dave\", \"score\" : 85 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### \\$project (select)\r\n\r\nNaturally, we’re going to want to reduce the documents into smaller objects — returning just the fields we want, or aliasing their names. In the SQL paradigm, this sounds like a SELECT , for Mongo it’s \\$project .\r\n\r\nWe can actually compose very complex serialization routines using $project with <expression> . Otherwise, including a field is as easy as passing <field>: <1 or true> . The documents returned to the next stage of the pipeline will only contain the values specified by $project.\r\n\r\n### Pipeline Concept\r\n\r\nMongoDB’s aggregation framework is modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into an aggregated result.\r\n\r\nThe most basic pipeline stages provide filters (whcih is the $match) that operate like queries and document transformations ($group) that modify the form of the output document.\r\n\r\nIn UNIX command, shell pipeline means the possibility to execute an operation on some input and use the output as the input for the next command and so on. MongoDB also supports same concept in aggregation framework. There is a set of possible stages and each of those is taken as a set of documents as an input and produces a resulting set of documents (or the final resulting JSON document at the end of the pipeline). This can then in turn be used for the next stage and so on.\r\n\r\n#### Following are the possible stages in aggregation framework −\r\n\r\n\\$project − Used to select some specific fields from a collection.\r\n\r\n\\$match − This is a filtering operation and thus this can reduce the amount of documents that are given as input to the next stage.\r\n\r\n\\$group − This does the actual aggregation as discussed above.\r\n\r\n\\$sort − Sorts the documents.\r\n\r\n\\$skip − With this, it is possible to skip forward in the list of documents for a given amount of documents.\r\n\r\n\\$limit − This limits the amount of documents to look at, by the given number starting from the current positions.\r\n\r\n\\$unwind − This is used to unwind document that are using arrays. When using an array, the data is kind of pre-joined and this operation will be undone with this to have individual documents again. Thus with this stage we will increase the amount of documents for the next stage.\r\n\r\n#### Other Reading\r\n\r\nhttps://engineering.universe.com/mongo-aggregations-in-5-minutes-b8e1d9c274bb\r\n"

This becomes an issue when the code for the application gets pushed up to a public facing source control like GitHub. Once the code is up there it is accessible to anyone that sees it. And so are your keys.\r\n\r\nYou could add all of the files with sensitive information to your .gitignore file? You could, but then this would prevent all needed files from getting into source control. And anyone wanting to help write the code wouldn’t have a complete version.\r\n\r\nOne solution for this is to use environment variables. These are local variables that are made available to an application. Creating these variables is made easy with a tool like dotenv. This module loads environment variables from a .env file that you create and adds them to the process.env object that is made available to the application.\r\n\r\n### Next add the following line to your app.js or server.js or bin/www  - whichever is the entry file to your app.\r\n\r\n``require('dotenv').config()``\r\n\r\ncreate a .env file at the root directory of your application and add the variables to it.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nMONGO_DB=mongodb://localhost:27017/ap-port-login\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Most importantly - add ``.env`` to your ‘.gitignore’ file so that Git ignores it and it never ends up on GitHub. You can add any keys you want to this file.\r\n\r\n### Only drawback - I need to put this li ( require('dotenv').config() ) in every single file where I want to use environment variables AND I have to deploy the dotenv to production where I don’t actually need it.\r\n\r\n### Then in my config/config.js - where I am initiating the mongodb connection\r\n\r\n```js\r\n'use strict'\r\n\r\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    'database': process.env.MONGO_DB,\r\n\r\n    // connect function to create a mongoDB connection\r\n    'connectDB' : function () {\r\n        mongoose.connect(this.database)\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n// on mongo connection open event print a console statement\r\nmongoose.connection.on('open', function () {\r\n    console.log('Connected to Database (MongoDB) ');\r\n})\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### And in my ./app.js\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconfig.connectDB()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Some other examples of the use case of .env file\r\n\r\n```js\r\n//contents of .env\r\nSECRET_KEY=abcd1234\r\nconst port = 5000\r\n\r\n// in my app.js\r\n\r\nconst express = require('express');\r\nconst app = express();\r\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\r\nrequire('dotenv').config();\r\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\r\n    res.send(process.env.SECRET_KEY);\r\n})\r\napp.listen(port, () => {\r\n    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}.`)\r\n})\r\n\r\n```"

        "content": "### How GridFS works and why we would need this\r\n\r\nMongodb provides us with a very efficient way to store files directly in db rather than in file system. So basically what this means is, suppose you need to store an image file or an audio or video file you can directly store that in mongodb itself.\r\n\r\nHowever, MongoDB is a NoSQL document-database, meaning it stores the data in the form of documents. Default document size limit in MongoDB is 16MB. That is if you want to store files upto 16MB then it’s not a big deal. But to store heavy files of size exceeding 16MB, MongoDB provides a module called GridFS. What GridFS does is that it divides your files into the chunks of 255kB (initially it was 256kB) and then stores it into the database.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly happens is it creates two collections in your database instance that you are currently using. In one collection, it stores the 255kB chunks of the files and the other collection is a document that contains the meta-data of your file.\r\n\r\n[Official document page](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/)\r\n\r\nTo use with GridFS and multer for file upload functionality, two other very important packages we would use are `multer-gridfs-storage` and `gridfs-stream` like so.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst GridFsStorage = require('multer-gridfs-storage');\r\n\r\nconst Grid = require('gridfs-stream');\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy multer-gridfs-storage - https://github.com/devconcept/multer-gridfs-storage/wiki/Using-generator-functions - GridFS storage engine for Multer to store uploaded files directly to MongoDb.\r\n\r\ngridfs-stream is required for streaming files to and from MongoDB GridFS.\r\n\r\nThe gridfs-stream module exports a constructor that accepts an open mongodb-native db and the mongodb-native driver you are using. The db must already be opened before calling **createWriteStream** or **createReadStream**.\r\n"

        "content": "An index in MongoDB is a special data structure that holds the data of few fields of documents on which the index is created. Indexes improve the speed of search operations in database because instead of searching the whole document, the search is performed on the indexes that holds only few fields. On the other hand, having too many indexes can hamper the performance of insert, update and delete operations because of the additional write and additional data space used by indexes.\r\n\r\nHow to create index in MongoDB\r\nSyntax:\r\n\r\n`db.collection_name.createIndex({field_name: 1 or -1})`\r\n\r\nThe value 1 is for ascending order and -1 is for descending order.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have a collection studentdata. The documents inside this collection have following fields:\r\nstudent_name, student_id and student_age\r\n\r\nLets say I want to create the index on student_name field in ascending order:\r\n\r\n`db.studentdata.createIndex({student_name: 1})`\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n        \"createdCollectionAutomatically\" : false,\r\n        \"numIndexesBefore\" : 1,\r\n        \"numIndexesAfter\" : 2,\r\n        \"ok\" : 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Finding the indexes in a collection\r\n\r\nWe can use **getIndexes**() method to find all the indexes created on a collection. The syntax for this method is:\r\n\r\ndb.collection_name.getIndexes()\r\nSo to get the indexes of studentdata collection, the command would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndb.studentdata.getIndexes()\r\n[\r\n        {\r\n                \"v\" : 2,\r\n                \"key\" : {\r\n                        \"_id\" : 1\r\n                },\r\n                \"name\" : \"_id_\",\r\n                \"ns\" : \"test.studentdata\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n                \"v\" : 2,\r\n                \"key\" : {\r\n                        \"student_name\" : 1\r\n                },\r\n                \"name\" : \"student_name_1\",\r\n                \"ns\" : \"test.studentdata\"\r\n        }\r\n]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output shows that we have two indexes in this collection. The default index created on _id and the index that we have created on student_name field.\r\n\r\n#### Default _id Index\r\n\r\nThis is the default index which will be created by MongoDB when you create a new collection. If you don’t specify any value for this field, then _id will be primary key by default for your collection so that a user can’t insert two documents with same _id field values. You can’t remove this index from the _id field."

Every database will have a physical file associated in the file system.\r\n\r\n## 1) What is a Collection?\r\n\r\nThe Collection is group of Documents in MongoDB. In RDBMS, this can be considered as a table which will have list records (documents in MongoDB).\r\n\r\n2) What is a Document?\r\n\r\nThe Document is a set of key-value pairs. In RDBMS, each record in a table is equivalent to document in MongoDB. Documents will have a dynamic schema, meaning, documents in a collection no need to have a same structure/fields.\r\n\r\n## 2) Compare MongoDB and RDBMS? - Below are MongoDB equivalent in RDBMS –\r\n\r\n|     | MongoDB            | RDBMS      |\r\n| --- | ------------------ | ---------- |\r\n|     | Database           | Database   |\r\n| --- | ---                | ---        |\r\n|     | Collection         | Table      |\r\n| --- | ---                | ---        |\r\n|     | Document           | Record/Row |\r\n| --- | ---                | ---        |\r\n|     | Field              | Column     |\r\n| --- | ---                | ---        |\r\n|     | Embedded Documents | Table Join |\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3) What is “mongod”?\r\n\r\nIt is a host process for the database. When we start mongod, it means starting the MongoDB process and run it in the background.\r\n\r\n## 4) What is Mongoose ?\r\n\r\n**Mongoose is an Object Document Mapper (ODM)**. This means that Mongoose allows you to define objects with a strongly-typed schema that is mapped to a MongoDB document.\r\n\r\nMongoose provides an incredible amount of functionality around creating and working with schemas. Mongoose currently contains eight SchemaTypes that a property is saved as when it is persisted to MongoDB. They are:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString\r\nNumber\r\nDate\r\nBuffer\r\nBoolean\r\nMixed\r\nObjectId\r\nArray\r\n\r\n```\r\nEach data type allows you to specify:\r\n\r\n```\r\na default value\r\na custom validation function\r\nindicate a field is required\r\na get function that allows you to manipulate the data before it is returned as an object\r\na set function that allows you to manipulate the data before it is saved to the database\r\ncreate indexes to allow data to be fetched faster\r\n\r\n```\r\nFurther to these common options, certain data types allow you to further customize how the data is stored and retrieved from the database. For example, a String data type also allows you to specify the following additional options:\r\n\r\nconvert it to lowercase\r\nconvert it to uppercase\r\ntrim data prior to saving\r\na regular expression that can limit data allowed to be saved during the validation process\r\nan enum that can define a list of strings that are valid\r\n\r\nThe `Number` and `Date` properties both support specifying a minimum and maximum value that is allowed for that field.\r\n\r\nThe **Buffer** data type allows you to save binary data. A common example of binary data would be an image or an encoded file, such as a PDF document.\r\n\r\nThe **Mixed** data type turns the property into an \"anything goes\" field. This field resembles how many developers may use MongoDB because there is no defined structure. Be wary of using this data type as it loses many of the great features that Mongoose provides, such as data validation and detecting entity changes to automatically know to update the property when saving.\r\n\r\nThe **ObjectId** data type commonly specifies a link to another document in your database. For example, if you had a collection of books and authors, the book document might contain an ObjectId property that refers to the specific author of the document.\r\n\r\nThe **Array** data type allows you to store JavaScript-like arrays. With an Array data type, you can perform common JavaScript array operations on them, such as push, pop, shift, slice, etc."

They return a query object that you can add (or chain) other queries to. The queries are all run as a unit when needed so there isn't any storing of unneeded intermediate results. This is what the exec() function does. You'll sometime hear it referred to as \"lazy loading\" or \"lazy evaluation\"\r\n\r\n3> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose\r\n\r\n### All callbacks in Mongoose use the pattern: callback(error, result).\r\n\r\nIf an error occurs executing the query, the error parameter will contain an error document, and result will be null. If the query is successful, the error parameter will be null, and the result will be populated with the results of the query.\r\n\r\nYou can search for records using query methods, specifying the query conditions as a JSON document. The code fragment below shows how you might find all athletes in a database that play tennis, returning just the fields for athlete name and age. Here we just specify one matching field (sport) but you can add more criteria, specify regular expression criteria, or remove the conditions altogether to return all athletes.\r\n\r\n``var Athlete = mongoose.model('Athlete', yourSchema);``\r\n\r\n// find all athletes who play tennis, selecting the 'name' and 'age' fields\r\n\r\n```js\r\nAthlete.find({ 'sport': 'Tennis' }, 'name age', function (err, athletes) {\r\n  if (err) return handleError(err);\r\n  // 'athletes' contains the list of athletes that match the criteria.\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you specify a callback, as shown above, the query will execute immediately. The callback will be invoked when the search completes.\r\n\r\n## If you don't specify a callback then the API will return a variable of type Query. You can use this query object to build up your query and then execute it (with a callback) later using the exec() method.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// find all athletes that play tennis\r\nvar query = Athlete.find({ 'sport': 'Tennis' });\r\n\r\n// selecting the 'name' and 'age' fields\r\nquery.select('name age');\r\n\r\n// limit our results to 5 items\r\nquery.limit(5);\r\n\r\n// sort by age\r\nquery.sort({ age: -1 });\r\n\r\n// execute the query at a later time\r\nquery.exec(function (err, athletes) {\r\n  if (err) return handleError(err);\r\n  // athletes contains an ordered list of 5 athletes who play Tennis\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n4> A nice example of how using the Promise returning feature of .exec makes it possible to avoid callback hell\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.revathskumar.com/2015/07/using-promises-with-mongoosejs.html"

        "content": "##### `.populate()` is a way to populate referenced subdocuments in any schema.\r\n\r\nLets take an example of a social network, one collection for users, and one for posts. In my research before doing any coding, I stumbled upon `Model.populate()`, a Mongoose method that you can use to essentially link documents across collections.\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Make your schemas\r\n\r\nYou need a schema for each collection. One for the users, and one for the posts those users are going to make.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\r\n  username: String,\r\n  posts: [\r\n    {\r\n      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,\r\n      ref: \"Post\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst PostSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\r\n  content: String,\r\n  author: {\r\n    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,\r\n    ref: \"User\"\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst Post = mongoose.model(\"Post\", PostSchema, \"posts\");\r\nconst User = mongoose.model(\"User\", UserSchema, \"users\");\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  User,\r\n  Post\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Most simply - If you run this query: Post.find({}).populate('user').exec(callback), Mongoose will look at the field user in the post, see that it has a ref to the User model, and find that user by its \\_id\r\n\r\nThis tells Mongoose “Hey, I’m gonna be referencing other documents from other collections”. The next part of that property is the ref (Post or User in the above code). The ref tells Mongoose “Those docs are going to be in the Post or User collection.”\r\n\r\nSo in our User schema, we reference the Post collection, because we want the user to be tied to the things they post, and we want to be able to easily access those posts without having to create more queries.\r\n\r\nAfter linking other collections in your schema using the appropriate type and ref, your actual stored data for that property will be another document’s \\_id. It will be stored as a string. This also works for an array of \\_ids.\r\n\r\nSo while your schema says this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\r\n  username: String,\r\n  posts: [\r\n    {\r\n      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,\r\n      ref: \"Post\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Your actual stored property should read something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  _id: 59ab1c92ea84486fb4ba9f28,\r\n  username: JD,\r\n  posts: [\r\n    \"59ab1b43ea84486fb4ba9ef0\",\r\n    \"59ab1b43ea84486fb4ba9ef1\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this is your stored document. We have not called .populate() on it yet.\r\n\r\n#### Once it is called, it will go to the appropriate collection, search for those two \\_ids, and return your user, but now with an array of her actual posts. Let’s do that now.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction getUserWithPosts(username) {\r\n    return User.findOne({ username: username })\r\n        .populate('posts').exec(err, posts) => {\r\n            console.log(\"Populated User \" + posts)\r\n        })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`.populate()` needs a query to attach itself to, so we are using User.findOne() to find a user who matches the username we provide in the argument. This returns our user document. This is when .populate() takes over.\r\n\r\n#### You’ll notice I am providing ‘posts’ to our .populate(). By providing the ‘posts’ argument, we’ve told .populate() what property in our user document we want it to work with. Calling .exec() just executes something once .populate() has done it’s thing. The log prints this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  _id: 59ab1c92ea84486fb4ba9f28,\r\n  username: 'JD',\r\n  posts:\r\n    [\r\n      {\r\n        _id: 59ab1b43ea84486fb4ba9ef0,\r\n        content: \"Is it dark out?\"\r\n      },{\r\n        _id: 59ab1b43ea84486fb4ba9ef1,\r\n        content: \"Hey anyone got a cup of sugar?\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Arrays of ObjectId refs works like this. Just call the populate method on the query and an array of documents will be returned in place of the ObjectIds.\r\n\r\nAnd like magic, we have created a unified object using 2 schemas, 2 models, and 2 collections. All of the steps are important of course, but the thing that no other site made explicitly clear was that after setting up the ground work, you have to make sure you are pushing \\_ids into the field you will need populated later.\r\n\r\n### 2nd Implementation\r\n\r\nLet’s pretend we’re building a social app, and we have two models: a User and a Post:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar UserSchema = {\r\n  _id: String,\r\n  username: String\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar PostSchema = {\r\n  _id: String,\r\n  user: {\r\n    ref: 'User',\r\n    type: String\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you run this query: `Post.find({}).populate('user').exec(callback)`, Mongoose will look at the field user in the post, see that it has a ref to the User model, and find that user by its \\_id\r\n\r\n### 3rd Implementation in my DevBook Repo\r\n\r\nIn Profile model, I have the the 'user' property as ObjectId like below,\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst ProfileSchema = new Schema({\r\n  user: {\r\n    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,\r\n    ref: 'users'\r\n  },\r\n  handle: {\r\n    type: String,\r\n    required: true,\r\n    max: 40\r\n  },\r\n  ---\r\n  ---\r\n  });\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = Profile = mongoose.model('profile', ProfileSchema);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in my Profile routes I have the following API endpoint\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrouter.get(\r\n  \"/\",\r\n  passport.authenticate(\"jwt\", { session: false }),\r\n  (req, res) => {\r\n    const errors = {}; // just like in user route, I want to append to the errors object for any actual errors that will be generated. And returning that object for the error case\r\n\r\n    Profile.findOne({ user: req.user.id })\r\n      .populate(\"user\", [\"name\", \"avatar\"])\r\n      .then(profile => {\r\n        if (!profile) {\r\n          errors.noprofile = \"There is not profile for this user\";\r\n          return res.status(404).json(errors);\r\n        }\r\n        res.json(profile);\r\n      })\r\n      .catch(err => res.status(404).json(err));\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above A) I am populating my user's profile using the query builder. http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html#population\r\n\r\nB) The first parameter of .populate() is the model you wish to use for population. If not specified, populate will look up the model by the name in the Schema's 'ref' field.\r\nhttp://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query_Query-populate\r\n\r\nC) The second parameter to .populate() is the Field selection for the population query. So here, I only wanted to show the name and avatar of the current logged-in user. So, I pass, ['name', 'avatar']\r\n\r\nD) Population is the process of automatically replacing the specified paths in the document with document(s) from other collection(s). So, when I do the below\r\n\r\nProfile.findOne({ user: req.user.id })\r\n.populate('user', ['name', 'avatar'])\r\n\r\nPopulated paths are no longer set to their original \\_id , their value is replaced with the mongoose document returned from the database by performing a separate query before returning the results.\r\n(http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html)\r\n\r\nE) .populate() needs a query to attach itself to, so we are using Profile.findOne() to find a profile who matches the id I provide in the argument. This returns our user document. This is when .populate() takes over.\r\n\r\nF) Flow of .populate() -> After findOne() finds the req.user.id and assigns it to the variable 'user' > .populate() is called on user, it will go to the appropriate collection (user model in this case) , search for that \\_ids, and return my user with 'name' and 'avatar'\r\n\r\nG) Why I can fetch user's model data with below line from profile route.\r\n\r\nProfile.findOne({ user: req.user.id })\r\n.populate('user', ['name', 'avatar'])\r\n\r\nBecause - In Profile model, I have the the 'user' property as ObjectId\r\n\r\n### Sources to read\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/@nicknauert/mongooses-model-populate-b844ae6d1ee7](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/populate.html)\r\n\r\n[https://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/populate.html](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/populate.html)\r\n"

The book schema will contain a reference to the author schema.\r\n\r\n#### Author.js\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar authorSchema = mongoose.Schema({\r\n  _id: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,\r\n  name: {\r\n    firstName: String,\r\n    lastName: String\r\n  },\r\n  biography: String,\r\n  twitter: String,\r\n  facebook: String,\r\n  linkedin: String,\r\n  profilePicture: Buffer,\r\n  created: {\r\n    type: Date,\r\n    default: Date.now\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar Author = mongoose.model(\"Author\", authorSchema);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbove is the author schema that expands upon the concepts of the user schema that I created in the previous example. To link the Author and Book together, the first property of the author schema is an \\_id property that is an ObjectId schema type. \\_id is the common syntax for creating a primary key in Mongoose and MongoDB. Then, like the user schema, I've defined a name property containing the author's first and last name.\r\n\r\nExpanding upon the user schema, the author contains several other String schema types. I've also added a Buffer schema type that could hold the author's profile picture. The final property holds the created date of the author; however, you may notice it is created slightly differently because it has defined a default value of \"now\". When an author is persisted to the database, this property will be set to the current date/time.\r\n\r\nNow let's create a book schema that contains a reference to the author by using the ObjectId schema type:\r\n\r\n#### Book.js\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar bookSchema = mongoose.Schema({\r\n  _id: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,\r\n  title: String,\r\n  summary: String,\r\n  isbn: String,\r\n  thumbnail: Buffer,\r\n  author: {\r\n    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,\r\n    ref: \"Author\"\r\n  },\r\n  ratings: [\r\n    {\r\n      summary: String,\r\n      detail: String,\r\n      numberOfStars: Number,\r\n      created: {\r\n        type: Date,\r\n        default: Date.now\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  created: {\r\n    type: Date,\r\n    default: Date.now\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar Book = mongoose.model(\"Book\", bookSchema);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow save some objects in this model\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar jamieAuthor = new Author {\r\n    _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(),\r\n    name: {\r\n        firstName: 'Jamie',\r\n        lastName: 'Munro'\r\n    },\r\n    biography: 'Jamie is the author of ASP.NET MVC 5 with Bootstrap and Knockout.js.',\r\n    twitter: 'https://twitter.com/endyourif',\r\n    facebook: 'https://www.facebook.com/End-Your-If-194251957252562/'\r\n};\r\n\r\njamieAuthor.save(function(err) {\r\n    if (err) throw err;\r\n\r\n    console.log('Author successfully saved.');\r\n\r\n    var mvcBook = new Book {\r\n            _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(),\r\n            title: 'ASP.NET MVC 5 with Bootstrap and Knockout.js',\r\n            author: jamieAuthor._id,\r\n            ratings:[{\r\n                summary: 'Great read'\r\n            }]\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    mvcBook.save(function(err) {\r\n        if (err) throw err;\r\n\r\n        console.log('Book successfully saved.');\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    var knockoutBook = new Book {\r\n            _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(),\r\n            title: 'Knockout.js: Building Dynamic Client-Side Web Applications',\r\n            author: jamieAuthor._id\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    knockoutBook.save(function(err) {\r\n        if (err) throw err;\r\n\r\n        console.log('Book successfully saved.');\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example starts by creating and saving a jamieObject that is created from anAuthor Model. Inside the save function of the jamieObject, if an error occurs, the application will output an exception. When the save is successful, inside the save function, the two book objects are created and saved. Similar to the jamieObject, if an error occurs when saving, an error is outputted; otherwise, a success message is outputted in the console.\r\n\r\nTo create the reference to the Author, both of the book objects reference the author schema's \\_id primary key in the author property of the book schema.\r\n"

[See the other file \"referencing-another-schema-in-Mongoose-1.md ]\r\n\r\nHere I created a mongoose schema for user data, notice that the type of friends is itself a type of ObjectId and has a ref property, this is how mongoose perform collection linking or join or relationships. Each user would have a friends array which would hold id values of other friends that they are friends with. back in the all method in our controller where we call populate function on UserModel we are telling mongoose to swap the id values for the real collection that those values represent.\r\n\r\n#### And then in my src/models/post/post.js\r\n\r\nA post has comment and a user who created it. That is, a Post belong to a User, hence it's 'creator' property will have its ref to `User`\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Schema = new mongoose.Schema({\r\n  creator: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },\r\n  title: { type: String, required: true },\r\n  body: { type: String, required: true }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = mongoose.model('Post', Schema)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### And this is my comment.js file. A comment belong to a Post, hence the 'post' property will have its ref to `Post`\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Schema = new mongoose.Schema({\r\n  post: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: \"Post\" },\r\n  body: { type: String, required: true }\r\n});\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = mongoose.model(\"Comment\", Schema);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### The ref attribute\r\n\r\nDBRefs have the following fields:\r\n\r\n$ref - The $ref field holds the name of the collection where the referenced document resides.\r\n\r\n$id - The $id field contains the value of the \\_id field in the referenced document.\r\n\r\n$db - Optional.\r\n\r\nContains the name of the database where the referenced document resides.\r\n\r\nOnly some drivers support $db references.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/database-references/#dbrefs\r\n\r\n### More sources to read about\r\n\r\n1> [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/database-references/](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/database-references/)\r\n\r\n2>[https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-mongoose-for-mongodb-and-nodejs--cms-29527](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-mongoose-for-mongodb-and-nodejs--cms-29527)\r\n"

        "content": "#  Understanding Middleware  - the core concept behind Express.js request processing and routing\r\n\r\nMiddleware refers to reusable components that can be plugged into an Express application. Middleware consists of functions that handle HTTP requests, such as the one we would pass to Node's native http.createServer function. A middleware component can add features by manipulating the request and response objects and then send the response to the client or pass control to the following middleware in\r\nthe stack.\r\n\r\nTo load a middleware into an Express application, we call the app.use() method. The app.use() method takes an optional path parameter as the first argument, which is useful if we want to mount certain functionalities to an endpoint. When using the path parameter, the middleware will be executed only if the URL matches that path. Practical use cases include serving static assets under the /public path or loading special middleware for an admin path\r\n\r\n3> https://medium.com/@adamzerner/middleware-in-express-60d75055ba8f  -  GOOD\r\n\r\nTo understand how middleware works in Express, there’s a few things you have to understand:\r\n\r\n### You could have multiple routes that match an incoming request.\r\n\r\n### Routes are executed from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n### If a route matches an incoming request, subsequent routes that match the incoming request won’t be hit if you don’t call next().\r\n\r\nLet me explain.\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\r\n  console.log('one');\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\r\n  console.log('two');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere’s what will happen if there’s an incoming GET / request:\r\n\r\nIt will match the first route. The code in the first route will be executed. “The buck stops here”. Even though the second route matches the incoming request.\r\n\r\nSo how would we get “two” to be logged as well?\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.get('/', function(req, res, next) {\r\n  console.log('one');\r\n  next();\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\r\n  console.log('two');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow…\r\n\r\nGET /\r\noutputs\r\n\r\none\r\ntwo\r\n\r\n## Calling ``next()`` allows “the buck to NOT stop here”.\r\n\r\n# Understanding app.use() middleware\r\n\r\n## 1> Best Explanation - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15601703/difference-between-app-use-and-app-get-in-express-js\r\n\r\napp.use() is intended for binding middleware to your application. The path is a \"mount\" or \"prefix\" path and limits the middleware to only apply to any paths requested that begin with it. It can even be used to embed another application:\r\n\r\n## By specifying ‘/users’ as a \"mount\" path, app.use() will respond to any path that starts with ‘/users’  -  which are all of them and regardless of HTTP verb used:\r\n\r\n## GET /users\r\n## PUT /users/foo\r\n## POST /users/foo/bar\r\n\r\n## 2> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11321635/nodejs-express-what-is-app-use\r\n\r\nTo setup your middleware, you can invoke app.use (<specific_middleware_layer_here>) for every middleware layer that you want to add (it can be generic to all paths, or triggered only on specific path(s) your server handles), and it will add onto your Express middleware stack.\r\n\r\nMiddleware layers can be added one by one in multiple invocations of use, or even all at once in series with one invocation.\r\n\r\nEach middleware layer is essentially adding a function that specifically handles something to your flow through the middleware.\r\n\r\n**app.use(bodyParser)**  -  by adding bodyParser, you're ensuring your server handles incoming requests through the express middleware. So, now parsing the body of incoming requests is part of the procedure that your middleware takes when handling incoming requests -- all because you called app.use(bodyParser).\r\n\r\n## 3> app.use defined - http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/proto.html#app.use\r\n\r\nOfficial - https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html\r\n\r\n### Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.\r\n\r\nMiddleware functions can perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nExecute any code.\r\n\r\nMake changes to the request and the response objects.\r\n\r\nEnd the request-response cycle.\r\n\r\nCall the next middleware function in the stack.\r\n\r\nIf the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.\r\n\r\n## 4> https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html - From Official dox\r\n\r\nBind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the app.use() and app.METHOD() functions, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request that the middleware function handles (such as GET, PUT, or POST) in lowercase.\r\n\r\nThis example shows a middleware function mounted on the /user/:id path. The function is executed for any type of HTTP request on the /user/:id path.\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.use('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {\r\n  console.log('Request Type:', req.method)\r\n  next()\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n3> **app.use applies the specified middleware to the main app middleware stack**.\r\n\r\nWhen attaching middleware ( the function passed to app.use below is the middleware) to the main app stack, the order of attachment matters; if you attach middleware A before middleware B, middleware A will always execute first. You can specify a path for which a particular middleware is applicable. In the below example, “hello world” will always be logged before “happy holidays.”\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nconst express = require('express');\r\nconst app = express();\r\n\r\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\r\n    console.log(\"hello world\")\r\n})\r\n\r\napp.use(function(req, res, next) {\r\n    console.log(\"happy world\")\r\n})\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## app.use() acts as a middleware in express apps. Unlike app.get() and app.post() or so, you actually can use app.use() without specifying the request URL. In such a case what it does is, it gets executed every time no matter what URL's been hit.\r\n\r\n## 4> The order of middleware loading is important:\r\n\r\nTo load the middleware function, call app.use(), specifying the middleware function. For example, the following code loads the myLogger middleware function before the route to the root path (/).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar app = express()\r\n\r\nvar myLogger = function (req, res, next) {\r\n  console.log('LOGGED')\r\n  next()\r\n}\r\n\r\napp.use(myLogger)\r\n\r\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\r\n  res.send('Hello World!')\r\n})\r\n\r\napp.listen(3000)\r\n```"

Express will listen for requests for that route, and when it’s hit, it will call the function you provided and give it three parameters: request, response and next (actually four but let keep things simple for now).\r\n\r\nThe params are the request, response and next. No matter what you call them or not, express will in its internal workings call the function you provided like this:\r\n\r\nfunction myCallback(requestObject, responseObject, nextMiddleware) {\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe requestObject: contains information about the HTTP request. You can access the request headers, full url, caller IP address etc within the requestObject.\r\n\r\nThe responseObject: is used to handle the requestObject. The responseObject represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.\r\n\r\nThe next : this may accept a parameter or may not. When it does not accept a parameter, it means go to the next executable. It is a way to escape from the middleware function.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The example below shows how you can add the middleware function using both methods, and with/without a route.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar express = require('express');\r\nvar app = express();\r\n\r\n// An example middleware function\r\nvar a_middleware_function = function(req, res, next) {\r\n  // ... perform some operations\r\n  next(); // Call next() so Express will call the next middleware function in the chain.\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Function added with use() for all routes and verbs\r\napp.use(a_middleware_function);\r\n\r\n// Function added with use() for a specific route\r\napp.use('/someroute', a_middleware_function);\r\n\r\n// A middleware function added for a specific HTTP verb and route\r\napp.get('/', a_middleware_function);\r\n\r\napp.listen(3000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction - Above we declare the middleware function separately and then set it as the callback. In our previous route handler function we declared the callback function when it was used. In JavaScript, either approach is valid.\r\n\r\n# Difference between app.get() and app.use()\r\n\r\n1> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15601703/difference-between-app-use-and-app-get-in-express-js\r\n\r\napp.get is called when the HTTP method is set to GET, whereas app.use is called regardless of the HTTP method, and therefore defines a layer which is on top of all the other RESTful types which the express packages gives you access to.\r\n\r\nSimply,\r\napp.use means “Run this on ALL requests”\r\n\r\napp.get means “Run this on a GET request, for the given URL”\r\n\r\n\r\n2> app.use --> It is generally used for introducing middlewares in your application and can handle all type of HTTP requests.\r\n\r\napp.get --> It is only for handling GET HTTP requests.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a confusion between app.use & app.all : No doubt, there is one thing common in them, that both can handle all kind of HTTP requests. But there are some differences which recommend us to use app.use for middlewares and app.all for route handling.\r\n\r\napp.use() -> It takes only one callback.\r\napp.all() -> It can take multiple callbacks.\r\n\r\napp.use() will only see whether url starts with specified path. But, app.all() will match the complete path.\r\n\r\n3>  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27162065 - GOOD EXPLANATION\r\n\r\nThe short answer is app.use('/',  express.static(__dirname + '/public')) will match any path that begins with /. This means that anything like/about and /contact are included.\r\n\r\nHowever, app.get('/',  express.static(__dirname + '/public')) will match only the specific route /. So, /about and /contact, for example, won't be included."

They turn any amount of data into a fixed-length \"fingerprint\" that cannot be reversed. They also have the property that if the input changes by even a tiny bit, the resulting hash is completely different (see the example above). This is great for protecting passwords, because we want to store passwords in a form that protects them even if the password file itself is compromised, but at the same time, we need to be able to verify that a user's password is correct.\r\n\r\nThe general workflow for account registration and authentication in a hash-based account system is as follows:\r\n\r\n1> The user creates an account.\r\n\r\n2> Their password is hashed and stored in the database. At no point is the plain-text (unencrypted) password ever written to the hard drive.\r\n\r\n3> When the user attempts to login, the hash of the password they entered is checked against the hash of their real password (retrieved from the database).\r\n\r\n4> If the hashes match, the user is granted access. If not, the user is told they entered invalid login credentials.\r\n\r\n5> Steps 3 and 4 repeat every time someone tries to login to their account.\r\n\r\n### bcrypt works in 2 steps, first genSalt and then hash the password with that salt\r\n\r\n### The regular steps are >> Generate the salt first (if err throw err else give me the salt)\r\n\r\n### and then hash the password with the generated salt (passing a cb so if there's error throw error else give me the hash).\r\n\r\nSo from [official doc](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js#usage---async) the below function is for the first step of **generating the salt and hashing**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync(10);\r\nvar hash = bcrypt.hashSync(\"B4c0//\", salt);\r\n\r\n// And to hash a password the ES6 Async way is combine them both without blocking any other operation\r\n\r\nbcrypt.genSalt(10, function(err, salt) {\r\n  bcrypt.hash(\"B4c0//\", salt, function(err, hash) {\r\n    // Store hash in your password DB.\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBcrypt allows us to choose the value of saltRounds, which gives us control over the cost of processing the data. The higher this number is, the longer it takes for the machine to calculate the hash associated with the password. It is important when choosing this value, to select a number high enough that someone who tries to find the password for a user by brute force, requires so much time to generate all the possible hash of passwords that does not compensate him. And on the other hand, it must be small enough so as not to end the user’s patience when registering and logging in (this patience is not usually very high). By default, the saltRounds value is 10.\r\n\r\n### One example of the first step of generating the salt and hashing - [https://github.com/rohan-paul/Tiny-Twitter-Clone/blob/master/models/user.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/Tiny-Twitter-Clone/blob/master/models/user.js)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nUserSchema.pre(\"save\", function(next) {\r\n  let user = this; // This is how I access UserSchema object\r\n\r\n  // I shall only hash the password if it has been modified (or is new). So, in below line I make sure if there was already a password and isModified in not true, then move-on with next()\r\n  if (!user.isModified(\"password\")) return next();\r\n\r\n  // and for new password\r\n  if (user.password) {\r\n    bcrypt.genSalt(10, function(err, salt) {\r\n      if (err) return next(err);\r\n      bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt, null, function(err, hash) {\r\n        if (err) return next(err);\r\n        user.password = hash;\r\n        next(err);\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation of `UserSchmea.pre` in above - Its the middleware - also known as “pre” and “post” hooks that tie particular functions to particular lifecycle and query events. This middleware is defined on the schema level and can modify the query or the document itself as it is executed. Middleware is invoked with two arguments: the event trigger (as a string) and the callback function that is triggered for that particular event. The callback itself takes in an argument of a function, which we typically call next , and when invoked — advances the document/query to the next awaiting middleware.\r\nSo what the below function does is - before (i.e. pre) user saves the normal text password into the database, making sure it encrypts it first\r\n\r\n### Example from my [dev-book app - https://github.com/rohan-paul/Developer-Profile-App/blob/master/routes/api/users.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/Developer-Profile-App/blob/master/routes/api/users.js)\r\n\r\n### First hashing and then save the hashed password into mongo\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// and then get other details of the new user from the post request\r\nconst newUser = new User({\r\n  name: req.body.name,\r\n  email: req.body.email,\r\n  avatar,\r\n  password: req.body.password\r\n});\r\n\r\nbcrypt.genSalt(10, (err, salt) => {\r\n  bcrypt.hash(newUser.password, salt, (err, hash) => {\r\n    if (err) throw err;\r\n    newUser.password = hash;\r\n    newUser\r\n      .save()\r\n      .then(user => res.json(user))\r\n      .catch(user => console.log(err));\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Next step before signing-in a new user, it compares the password with that saved in the database\r\n\r\nExample [https://github.com/rohan-paul/Developer-Profile-App/blob/master/routes/api/users.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/Developer-Profile-App/blob/master/routes/api/users.js)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrouter.post(\"/login\", (req, res) => {\r\n  /* I pass the data to the validateRegisterInput() function.

The compare function simply pulls the salt out of the hash and then uses it to hash the password and perform the comparison.\r\nWhen a user logs into our system, we need to check that the password entered is correct. Unlike other systems that would decrypt the password in the database (if it is encrypted), and compare it with the one entered by the user, what we do with bcrypt is encrypt the one entered by the user. To do this, we will pass the password to bcrypt to calculate the hash, but also the password stored in the database associated with the user (hash). This is because, as mentioned before, the bcrypt algorithm used a random segment (salt) to generate the hash associated with the pasword. This was stored along with the password, and you need it to recalculate the hash of the password entered by the user and finally compare with the one entered when registering and see if they match.\r\n\r\nLooking at the [source code of bcrypt.compare](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js/blob/b09f7f266a7015456b7b36deeb026dc636f64542/dist/bcrypt.js#L269) function makes the above steps clear\r\n\r\n```js\r\nbcrypt.compare = function(s, hash, callback, progressCallback) {\r\n  function _async(callback) {\r\n    if (typeof s !== \"string\" || typeof hash !== \"string\") {\r\n      nextTick(\r\n        callback.bind(\r\n          this,\r\n          Error(\"Illegal arguments: \" + typeof s + \", \" + typeof hash)\r\n        )\r\n      );\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n    if (hash.length !== 60) {\r\n      nextTick(callback.bind(this, null, false));\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n    bcrypt.hash(\r\n      s,\r\n      hash.substr(0, 29),\r\n      function(err, comp) {\r\n        if (err) callback(err);\r\n        else callback(null, safeStringCompare(comp, hash));\r\n      },\r\n      progressCallback\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  if (callback) {\r\n    if (typeof callback !== \"function\")\r\n      throw Error(\"Illegal callback: \" + typeof callback);\r\n    _async(callback);\r\n  } else\r\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\r\n      _async(function(err, res) {\r\n        if (err) {\r\n          reject(err);\r\n          return;\r\n        }\r\n        resolve(res);\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Online bcrypt hashing and de-hashing generator and checker\r\n\r\n[https://bcrypt-generator.com/](https://bcrypt-generator.com/)\r\n\r\nJust put the rounds (which is the salt length to generate, i.e. the function where I am hashing the plain-text password )\r\n\r\n`bcrypt.hashSync(plainTextPassword, 10)` So the number 10 is the rounds in the above online tool\r\n\r\nAfter hashing a plaintext password, for checking I will just put the hashed password from the mongo database - i.e. after running terminal command something like `db.users.find()` which will give all the users saved in the mongo database.\r\n\r\nSo an example is this hashed password - `$2a$10$m0mq4PYOOvm74Gukml4FN.T0Ntobhzi42T6b5v1WIsJ5aZkVzJz3a` And then put the round as 10 and I will get `123` which was my plaintext password in this case.\r\n"

Can you build the project without bodyParser\r\n\r\n**A> To handle HTTP POST request in Express.js version 4 and above, you need to install middleware module called body-parser.**\r\n\r\nbody-parser extract the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req.body.\r\n\r\nThe middleware was a part of Express.js earlier but now you have to install it separately.\r\n\r\nThis body-parser module parses the JSON, buffer, string and URL encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request.\r\n\r\nEach middleware layer is essentially adding a function that specifically handles something to your flow through the middleware.\r\n\r\n**app.use(bodyParser)**  -  by adding bodyParser, you're ensuring your server handles incoming requests through the express middleware. So, now parsing the body of incoming requests is part of the procedure that your middleware takes when handling incoming requests -- all because you called **app.use(bodyParser)**.\r\n\r\n**B> urlencoded - https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser#extended**\r\n\r\nThe extended option allows to choose between parsing the URL-encoded data with the querystring library (when false) or the qs library (when true). The \"extended\" syntax allows for rich objects and arrays to be encoded into the URL-encoded format, allowing for a JSON-like experience with URL-encoded.\r\n\r\n**C> https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-does-body-parser-do-with-express-js-and-why-do-I-need-it**\r\n\r\nTo go a little more in depth; body-parser gives you a middleware which uses nodejs/zlib to unzip the incoming request data if it's zipped and stream-utils/raw-body to await the full, raw contents of the request body before \"parsing it\" (this means that if you weren't going to use the request body, you just wasted some time).\r\n\r\nAfter having the raw contents, body-parser will parse it using one of four strategies, depending on the specific middleware you decided to use:\r\n\r\nbodyParser.raw(): Doesn't actually parse the body, but just exposes the buffered up contents from before in a Buffer on req.body.\r\n\r\nbodyParser.text(): Reads the buffer as plain text and exposes the resulting string on req.body.\r\n\r\nbodyParser.urlencoded(): Parses the text as URL encoded data (which is how browsers tend to send form data from regular forms\r\nset to POST) and exposes the resulting object (containing the keys and values) on req.body. For comparison; in PHP all of this is automatically done and exposed in $_POST.\r\n\r\nbodyParser.json(): Parses the text as JSON and exposes the resulting object on req.body.\r\n\r\nOnly after setting the req.body to the desirable contents will it call the next middleware in the stack, which can then access the request data without having to think about how to unzip and parse it.\r\n\r\n**D> body-parser does what it says it does: it parses the HTTP request body.**\r\n\r\nThis is usually necessary when you need to know more than just the URL being hit, more specifically in the context of a POST, PATCH or PUT HTTP request where the information you want is contained in the body.\r\n\r\nUsing body parser allows you to access req.body from within your routes, and use that data for example to create a user in a database.\r\n\r\nA lot of frameworks other than Express have this functionality baked into the library, Express being the minimalistic framework it is, has this as a separate middleware module.\r\n\r\nHope this explains it in a satisfactory fashion.\r\n\r\n**E> https://medium.com/@adamzerner/how-bodyparser-works-247897a93b90**\r\n\r\nbodyParser returns a function that acts as middleware. The function listens for req.on(‘data’) and constructs req.body from the chunks of data it gets.\r\n\r\nBasically, there are a bunch of different ways to format the data you POST to the server:\r\n\r\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\nmultipart/form-data\r\napplication/json\r\napplication/xml\r\nmaybe some others\r\n\r\nIn brief, bodyParser has to parse the data differently depending on its type (read here about the differences between the first two). And so you need to do something like this (from Express docs):\r\n\r\napp.use(bodyParser.json()); // for parsing application/json\r\n\r\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // for parsing application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n\r\napp.use(multer()); // for parsing multipart/form-data"

        "content": "[Official Doc](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer)\r\n\r\nPrior to the introduction of TypedArray, the JavaScript language had no mechanism for reading or manipulating streams of binary data. The Buffer class was introduced as part of the Node.js API to enable interaction with octet streams in TCP streams, file system operations, and other contexts.\r\n\r\nWith TypedArray now available, the Buffer class implements the Uint8Array API in a manner that is more optimized and suitable for Node.js.\r\n\r\nInstances of the Buffer class are similar to arrays of integers but correspond to fixed-sized, raw memory allocations outside the V8 heap. The size of the Buffer is established when it is created and cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nThe Buffer class is within the global scope, making it unlikely that one would need to ever use require('buffer').Buffer.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n// Creates a zero-filled Buffer of length 10.\r\nconst buf1 = Buffer.alloc(10);\r\n\r\n// Creates a Buffer of length 10, filled with 0x1.\r\nconst buf2 = Buffer.alloc(10, 1);\r\n\r\n// Creates an uninitialized buffer of length 10.\r\n// This is faster than calling Buffer.alloc() but the returned\r\n// Buffer instance might contain old data that needs to be\r\n// overwritten using either fill() or write().\r\nconst buf3 = Buffer.allocUnsafe(10);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Stream\r\n\r\nStream in Node.js simply means a sequence of data being moved from one point to the other over time. The whole concept is, you have a huge amount of data to process, but you don’t need to wait for all the data to be available before you start processing it.\r\n\r\nBasically, this big data is broken down and sent in chunks. So from the original definition of a buffer (“streams of binary data… in the context of… file system”) this simply means binary data being moved in the file system. For example, moving the texts stored in file1.txt to file2.txt.\r\n\r\n### Buffer\r\n\r\nWe’ve seen that a stream of data is the movement of data from one point to the other. But, there is a minimum and a maximum amount of data a process could take over time. So if the rate the data arrives is faster than the rate the process consumes the data, the excess data need to wait somewhere for its turn to be processed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the process is consuming the data faster than it arrives, the few data that arrive earlier need to wait for a certain amount of data to arrive before being sent out for processing.\r\n\r\nThat “waiting area” is the buffer! It is a small physical location in your computer, usually in the RAM, where data are temporally gathered, wait, and are eventually sent out for processing during streaming.\r\n\r\nWe can think of the whole stream and buffer process as a bus station. In some bus stations, a bus is not allowed to depart until a certain amount of passengers arrive or until a specific departure time. Also, the passengers may arrive at different times with different speed. Neither the passengers nor the bus station has control over passengers’ arrival at the station.\r\n\r\nIn whatever the case may be, there is always a waiting place. That is the Buffer to Node.js! Node.js can’t control the speed or time of data arrival, the speed of the stream. It only can decide when it’s time to send out the data. If it’s not yet time, Node.js will put them in the buffer — the “waiting area” — a small location in the RAM, until it’s time to send them out for processing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Interacting with a Buffer\r\n\r\nAside from the one Node.js will automatically create during a stream, it is possible to create and manipulate your own buffer. Interesting right? Let’s create one!\r\n\r\nDepending on what you want to achieve, there are different ways to create a buffer. Let’s see some.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Create an empty buffer of size 10.\r\n// A buffer that only can accommodate 10 bytes.\r\nconst buf1 = Buffer.alloc(10);\r\n// Create a buffer with content\r\nconst buf2 = Buffer.from(\"hello buffer\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Once your buffer has been created, you can start interacting with it\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n// Examine the structure of a buffer\r\nbuf1.toJSON()\r\n// { type: 'Buffer', data: [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ] }\r\n\r\n// an empty buffer\r\nbuf2.toJSON()\r\n// { type: 'Buffer',\r\n     data: [\r\n       104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 98, 117, 102, 102, 101, 114\r\n     ]\r\n   }\r\n// the toJSON() method presents the data as the Unicode Code Points of the characters\r\n// Examine the size of a buffer\r\n\r\nbuf1.length // 10\r\nbuf2.length // 12. Auto-assigned based on the initial content when created.\r\n// Write to a buffer\r\nbuf1.write(\"Buffer really rocks!\")\r\n\r\n// Decode a buffer\r\nbuf1.toString() // 'Buffer rea'\r\n//oops, because buf1 is created to contain only 10 bytes, it couldn't accommodate the rest of the characters\r\n// Compare two buffers\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Some more examples (https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_string_encoding)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst buf1 = Buffer.from('this is a tést');\r\nconst buf2 = Buffer.from('7468697320697320612074c3a97374', 'hex');\r\n\r\nconsole.log(buf1.toString());\r\n// Prints: this is a tést\r\nconsole.log(buf2.toString());\r\n// Prints: this is a tést\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Good References\r\n\r\n1> [https://medium.freecodecamp.org/do-you-want-a-better-understanding-of-buffer-in-node-js-check-this-out-2e29de2968e8](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/do-you-want-a-better-understanding-of-buffer-in-node-js-check-this-out-2e29de2968e8)"

But what happens when you upload very large files and load them into memory?\r\n\r\nImagine you want to download very large file and upload it to a destination. In this example, we’ll use the request module to both handle the download and the upload as a stream.\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to create a read stream when we download the file. Request automatically does this when you do a GET:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst request = require('request');\r\nconst readStream = request('https://dummydomain.com/some-very-large-file');\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce we have a read stream, we can simply pipe it into a POST request that will in turn upload the file to our destination:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nreadStream.pipe(request.post('https://dummydomain.com/some-destination'));\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nRather than loading the large file into memory, this sends chunks of data to the destination as soon as they’re downloaded, leaving a small memory footprint. Streams are great for handling chunks of data at a time and reducing memory use. In some cases, the expected memory usage of handling some kinds of data may not require the use of streams, but when memory usage is expected to be a bottleneck, then streams are extremely valuable for optimizing performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://carlosrymer.com/using-node-streams-to-handle-large-file-uploads-24c1a0141b9c"

Busboy is a Writable stream and its an alternative for multer. A writable stream is an abstraction for a destination to which data can be written. An example of that is the ``fs.createWriteStream`` method.\r\n\r\nOn busboy 'file' event you get parameter named 'file' and this is a stream so you can pipe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nbusboy.on('file', function(fieldname, file, filename, encoding, mimetype) => {\r\n    file.pipe(streamToSQS)\r\n})\r\n```\r\n[An example of file upload with busboy and express](https://gist.github.com/shobhitg/5b367f01b6daf46a0287)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// accept POST request on the homepage\r\napp.post('/', function (req, res) {\r\n    var busboy = new Busboy({ headers: req.headers });\r\n    busboy.on('file', function(fieldname, file, filename, encoding, mimetype) {\r\n      var saveTo = path.join('.', filename);\r\n      console.log('Uploading: ' + saveTo);\r\n      file.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(saveTo));\r\n    });\r\n    busboy.on('finish', function() {\r\n      console.log('Upload complete');\r\n      res.writeHead(200, { 'Connection': 'close' });\r\n      res.end(\"That's all folks!\");\r\n    });\r\n    return req.pipe(busboy);\r\n\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function ``fs.createWriteStream()`` creates a writable stream in a very simple manner. After a call to fs.createWriteStream with the filepath, you have a writeable stream to work with.\r\n\r\n## Comparison with multer\r\n\r\nSome developers opine that Multer is easier because it abstracts away some of the details of Busboy.\r\n\r\n### Difference between busboy and connect-busboy\r\n\r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39439922/difference-between-busboy-and-connect-busboy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39439922/difference-between-busboy-and-connect-busboy)\r\nConnect is a middleware layer for building servers in Node.js. It was originally the basis for the Express web framework.\r\n\r\nWhat middleware here really means is essentially an array of functions that conform to an interface which get called on each request in the order they are defined.\r\n\r\nconnect-busboy wraps the busboy library into a connect compatible middleware. You can see in the source it really just returns a function.\r\n\r\nIf you're using express you might want to take a look at express-busboy which uses connect-busboy under the hood and has recent updates.\r\n\r\n### What exactly are streams?*\r\n\r\nStreams are collections of data — just like arrays or strings. The difference is that streams might not be available all at once, and they don’t have to fit in memory. This makes streams really powerful when working with large amounts of data, or data that’s coming from an external source one chunk at a time.\r\n\r\nHowever, streams are not only about working with big data. They also give us the power of composability in our code. Just like we can compose powerful linux commands by piping other smaller Linux commands, we can do exactly the same in Node with streams.\r\n\r\n#### Here’s the magic line about pipe() and stream that you need to remember:\r\n\r\n``readableSrc.pipe(writableDest)``\r\n\r\nIn this simple line, we’re piping the output of a readable stream — the source of data, as the input of a writable stream — the destination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Using fs.createWriteStream()](https://stackabuse.com/writing-to-files-in-node-js/)\r\n\r\nWhen handling particularly large files, or files that come in chunks, say from a network connection, using streams is preferable to writing files in one go via the above methods that write entire files.\r\n\r\nStreams write small amounts of data at a time. While this has the disadvantage of being slower because data is transferred in chunks, it has advantages for RAM performance. Since the whole file is not loaded in memory all at once, RAM usage is lower.\r\n\r\nTo write to a file using streams, you need to create a new writable stream. You can then write data to the stream at intervals, all at once, or according to data availability from a server or other process, then close the stream for good once all the data packets have been written.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst fs = require('fs');\r\n\r\nconst writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('secret.txt');\r\n\r\n// write some data with a base64 encoding\r\nwriteStream.write('aef35ghhjdk74hja83ksnfjk888sfsf', 'base64');\r\n\r\n// the finish event is emitted when all data has been flushed from the stream\r\nwriteStream.on('finish', () => {\r\n    console.log('wrote all data to file')\r\n})\r\n\r\nwriteStream.end();\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe created a writable stream, then wrote some data to the stream. We have included a log statement when the \"finish\" event is emitted, letting us know that all data has been flushed to the underlying system. In this case, that means all data has been written to the file system.\r\n"

The form data will then appear in req.body.\r\n\r\n[Refer to Express official dox](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.cookies)\r\n\r\nWhen using cookie-parser middleware, this property is an object that contains cookies sent by the request. If the request contains no cookies, it defaults to {}.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Cookie: name=tj\r\nreq.cookies.name\r\n// => \"tj\"\r\nIf the cookie has been signed, you have to use req.signedCookies.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne of the header fields in HTTP request is COOKIE. i.e, each request made to the server carries the COOKIE data stored by the browser for that particular domain. Once sent, the server needs to parse this cookie data and use it to send the appropriate response. And here’s where the catch lies.\r\n\r\nNeither node.js’s http interface nor express.js parse the COOKIE field for you. They are extremely minimalistic, and you need to do this by yourself. That is where cookie-parser comes in. It parses the COOKIE header for you and populates **req.cookies** with an object keyed by the cookie names.\r\n\r\n#### Also you should be clear about is the relationship between cookie and session.\r\n\r\nCookie can live happily without session but session cannot live without cookie. It requires cookie to store session ID.\r\n\r\nTo handle cookie, you need middleware cookie-parser.\r\n\r\nTo handle session, you need middleware cookie-session.\r\n\r\nBecause session relies on cookie, therefore, set cookie-parser before cookie-session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### next question is how to set cookie in Express?\r\n\r\nYou need res.cookie(‘cookie-name’, ‘cookie-value’, {// cookie config obj.})\r\n\r\nThe first argument is cookie name and the second cookie value.\r\n\r\nThe third argument is optional. It contains several cookie settings. The third argument is also needed when deleting the cookie.\r\n\r\n### Reading Cookies?\r\nYou can access your Cookies via request object, req.cookies.cookie_name or req.cookies, second one return all the app cookies where first one return only the specific cookie. If the request contains no Cookies, it defaults to {}.\r\n\r\n### Deleting cookie?\r\nYou can also easily deleted Cookies by using response object’s clearCookie function, which accepts the name of the Cookie which you want to delete. You can also delete your Cookies from browser developers tools.\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.get('/clearcookie', function(req,res){\r\n     res.clearCookie('cookie_name');\r\n     res.send('Cookie deleted');\r\n});\r\napp.get('/clearcookie', function(req,res){\r\n     res.clearCookie('cookie_name');\r\n     res.send('Cookie deleted');\r\n});\r\n````"

This is also known as same-origin policy. In other words, browser security prevents a web page of one domain from executing AJAX calls on another domain.**\r\n**Note that an origin of a request comprises of: Scheme, Host and Port number. So, two requests are considered to be from the same origin if they have the same scheme, host and port number.

        "content": "There are 2 ways to report an error in middleware to Express. The first, as you saw above, is to throw an exception in the same tick. Because of the async nature of JavaScript, this isn't very useful. If you throw an error asynchronously, you'll just crash the server.\r\n\r\n[Official Error Handling Doc](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html)\r\n\r\nErrors that occur in synchronous code inside route handlers and middleware require no extra work. If synchronous code throws an error, then Express will catch and process it. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\r\n  throw new Error(\"BROKEN\"); // Express will catch this on its own.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor errors returned from asynchronous functions invoked by route handlers and middleware, you must pass them to the next() function, where Express will catch and process them. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res, next) {\r\n  fs.readFile(\"/file-does-not-exist\", function(err, data) {\r\n    if (err) {\r\n      next(err); // Pass errors to Express.\r\n    } else {\r\n      res.send(data);\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If you pass anything to the next() function (except the string 'route'), Express regards the current request as being an error and will skip any remaining non-error handling routing and middleware functions.\r\n\r\n## `throw error` vs `next(error)`\r\n\r\n`throw error` is brute-force ugly way to do error handling in ExpressJS apps. Basically, just throw the exception after it bubbles back up to the route handler.\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.get(\"/users\", function(req, res) {\r\n  User.find(function(err, users) {\r\n    // an error?! let's crash the app!\r\n    if (err) {\r\n      throw err;\r\n    }\r\n    // no error? ok, fine. do normal stuff here\r\n    // res.render... etc.\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works. If you don’t mind the app completely blowing chunks at this point and dumping itself entirely.\r\n\r\n#### But Unhandled exceptions should not be allowed to crash and exit the app.\r\n\r\nTherefore, you really want to handle this exception in your callback, properly.\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.get(\"/users\", function(req, res, next) {\r\n  User.find(function(err, users) {\r\n    // an error? get it out of here!\r\n    if (err) {\r\n      return next(err);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // no error? good. I'll do normal stuff here\r\n    // res.render... etc.\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe third parameter next calling which (next()) will switch the execution flow to the next handler.\r\n\r\nIt’s a simple change, but using `return next(err)` instead of `throw err` allows asynchronous code to raise an exception and still have it caught by the error handling pipeline in your app. Instead of putting the app into an unknown state where everything is potential dead or dangerous, calling `next(err)` tells the Express and Connect frameworks to pass the error along until an error handling middleware of function can properly take care of it.\r\n\r\n#### When to use next() and when to use return next() and some important difference?\r\n\r\nMost people always write return next() is to ensure that the execution stops after triggering the callback.\r\n\r\nIf you don't do it, you risk triggering the callback a second time later, which usually has devastating results.\r\n\r\nAn example of not using `return` here if you write middleware like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\r\n  console.log(\"This is a middleware\");\r\n  next();\r\n  console.log(\"This is first-half middleware\");\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\r\n  console.log(\"This is second middleware\");\r\n  next();\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\r\n  console.log(\"This is third middleware\");\r\n  next();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will find out that the output in console is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is a middleware\r\nThis is second middleware\r\nThis is third middleware\r\nThis is first-half middleware\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, it runs the code below next() after all middleware function finished.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you use return next(), it will jump out the callback immediately and the code below return next() in the callback will be unreachable.\r\n"

        "content": "#### There are four main ways to deliver an error in Node.js:\r\n\r\n- throw the error (making it an exception).\r\n- pass the error to a callback, a function provided specifically for handling errors and the results of asynchronous operations\r\n- pass the error to a reject Promise function\r\n- emit an \"error\" event on an EventEmitter\r\n\r\n##### Finally, you should know that in JavaScript (and Node.js especially), there's a difference between an error and an exception. An error is any instance of the Error class. Errors may be constructed and then passed directly to another function or thrown. When you throw an error, it becomes an exception.2 Here's an example of using an error as an exception:\r\n\r\n`throw new Error('something bad happened')`\r\n\r\nbut you can just as well create an Error without throwing it:\r\n\r\n`callback(new Error('something bad happened'))`\r\n\r\nAnd this is much more common in Node.js because most errors are asynchronous.\r\n\r\n#### Throw, Callback, Reject, or EventEmitter?\r\n\r\nThere are three basic patterns for a function to deliver errors.\r\n\r\n1> throw delivers an error synchronously — that is, in the same context where the function was called. If the caller (or the caller's caller, ...) used try/catch, then they can catch the error. If none of the callers did, the program usually crashes. (The error can also be handled by domains or the process-wide \"uncaughtException\" event, which are discussed below.)\r\n\r\n2> Callbacks are the most basic way of delivering an error asynchronously. The user passes you a function (the callback), and you invoke it sometime later when the asynchronous operation completes. The usual pattern is that the callback is invoked as callback(err, result), where only one of err and result is non-null, depending on whether the operation succeeded or failed.\r\nPromise rejections are a common way to deliver an error asynchrously. This method is growing in popularity since the release of Node.js version 8 that includes support for async/await. This allows asynchrounous code to be written to look like synchronous code and to catch errors using try/catch.\r\n\r\n3> For more complicated cases, instead of using a callback, the function itself can return an EventEmitter object, and the caller would be expected to listen for error events on the emitter. This is useful in two particular cases:\r\nWhen you're doing a complicated operation that may produce multiple errors or multiple results. For example, think about a request that fetches rows from a database and then streams the rows back as they arrive, rather than waiting for them all to arrive first. In this case, instead of taking a callback, your function would return an EventEmitter and emit row events for each result, an end event when all results have been reported, and an error event if any error is encountered.\r\nFor objects that represent complex state machines, where a lot of different asynchronous things can happen. For example, a socket is an event emitter that may emit \"connect\", \"end\", \"timeout\", \"drain\", and \"close\". It's natural to make \"error\" just another type of event that the socket can emit. When using this approach, it's important to be clear about when \"error\" is emitted, whether any other events may be emitted, what other events may be seen at the same time (e.g., \"close\"), what order they happen in, and whether the socket is closed at the end of it.\r\n\r\nBy far, the most common case is an operational error in an asynchronous function. For the majority of these, you'll want to have your function take a callback as an argument, and you'll just pass the error to the callback. This works very well, and is widely used. See the Node fs module for examples. If you've got a more complicated case like the ones described above, you may want to use an event emitter instead, but you'll still deliver the error asynchronously.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n1> [https://www.joyent.com/node-js/production/design/errors](https://www.joyent.com/node-js/production/design/errors) - This is very detailed and exhaustive coverage of the concept of errors in Node/Express\r\n\r\n2>\r\n"

If you just use an HTTP module, a lot of work like parsing the payload, cookies, storing sessions (in memory or in Redis), selecting the right route pattern based on regular expressions will have to be re-implemented. With Express.js it there for you to use.\r\n\r\n### Middleware functions allow you to take action on any incoming request and modify it before sending back a response. Each piece of middleware is just another request handler.\r\n\r\nThe difference between node.js and express.js is in the level of abstraction:\r\n\r\nNode.js is a platform for building server-side event-driven i/o application using javascript.\r\n\r\nExpress.js is a framework based on node.js for building web-application using principles and approaches of node.js"

Finally, in a more sophisticated way, we can use reactive extensions (RxJS) to define pipelines the manage events asynchronously\r\n\r\n## How can you listen on port 80 with Node?\r\n\r\nTrick question! You should not try to listen with Node on port 80 (in Unix-like systems) - to do so you would need superuser rights, but it is not a good idea to run your application with it.\r\n\r\nStill, if you want to have your Node.js application listen on port 80, here is what you can do. Run the application on any port above 1024, then put a reverse proxy like nginx in front of it.\r\n\r\n## Why npm shrinkwrap is useful?\r\n\r\nThis command locks down the versions of a package's dependencies so that you can control exactly which versions of each dependency will be used when your package is installed. - npmjs.com\r\n\r\nIt is useful when you are deploying your Node.js applications - with it you can be sure which versions of your dependencies are going to be deployed.\r\n\r\n## What's a stub? Name a use case.\r\n\r\nStubs are functions/programs that simulate the behaviours of components/modules. Stubs provide canned answers to function calls made during test cases. Also, you can assert on with what these stubs were called.\r\n\r\nA use-case can be a file read, when you do not want to read an actual file:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar fs = require('fs');\r\n\r\nvar readFileStub = sinon.stub(fs, 'readFile', function(path, callback) {\r\n    return callback(null, 'filecontent')\r\n})\r\n\r\nexpect(readFileStub).to.be.called;\r\nreadFileStub(restore);\r\n\r\n```"

An HTTP request doesn't recover automatically - if we fail to serve it, then we simply missed it.\r\n\r\n## Graceful shutdown in a Node.js application\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you need to listen for the SIGTERM signal and catch it:\r\n\r\n## 1. Handle process kill signal\r\n\r\nFirst let’s understand what is a process signal.\r\n\r\nA signal is an asynchronous notification sent to a process or to a specific thread to notify an event that occurred.\r\n\r\nSignal events will be emitted when the NodeJS process receives a signal.\r\n\r\nEach signal have name(i.e. 'SIGINT', 'SIGTERM', etc.).\r\n\r\n#### 'SIGINT' generated with <Ctrl>+C in the terminal.\r\n\r\n### The 'SIGTERM' signal is a generic signal used to cause program termination. Unlike 'SIGKILL', this signal can be blocked, handled, and ignored. It is the normal way to politely ask a program to terminate.\r\n\r\n### The shell command kill generates 'SIGTERM' by default.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about Termination Signals [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html.\r\n\r\nAs you guess we need to add handler which will receive 'SIGTERM' signal.\r\n\r\n### Here we have a simple server which has a route that creates user in MongoDB. And the code of graceful shutdown\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmongoose.connect(\r\n  \"mongodb://localhost/test\",\r\n  err => {\r\n    if (err) throw err;\r\n    console.log(\"Mongoose connected!\");\r\n  }\r\n);\r\nconst User = mongoose.model(\"User\", { name: String });\r\n\r\napp.post(\"/user\", async (req, res) => {\r\n  try {\r\n    const user = new User({ name: req.body.username });\r\n    await user.save();\r\n    res.send(\"Success!\").status(201);\r\n  } catch (err) {\r\n    res.send(err.message).status(500);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst server = app.listen(3000, () =>\r\n  console.log(\"Example app listening on port 3000!\")\r\n);\r\n\r\nprocess.on(\"SIGTERM\", () => {\r\n  console.info(\"SIGTERM signal received.\");\r\n  console.log(\"Closing http server.\");\r\n  server.close(() => {\r\n    console.log(\"Http server closed.\");\r\n    // boolean means [force], see in mongoose doc\r\n    mongoose.connection.close(false, () => {\r\n      console.log(\"MongoDb connection closed.\");\r\n      process.exit(0);\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Stop new requests from client\r\n\r\nNow we need to stop http server and stop accepting new requests.\r\nIt can be done using `server.close` function\r\n\r\n## 3. Close all data process\r\n\r\nAs you have seen our application exits ( generated with 'SIGTERM' event ) will also close database connection.\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause? - EventLoop\r\n\r\nAs we know NodeJS will exit when EventLoop queue is empty and nothing left to do.\r\n\r\nBut sometime your application can have more functions and will not exit automatically, in this point comes our last work to do.\r\nWe need to exit from process using process.exit function.\r\n\r\nArgument 0 means exit with a “success” code.\r\nTo exit with a “failure” code use 1.\r\n\r\nBy default NodeJS exits with process code 0 if EventLoop is empty.\r\n\r\n### Second Implementation\r\n\r\nMy config.js file as below\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst mongoose = require(\"mongoose\");\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  database: process.env.MONGO_DB,\r\n\r\n  options: {\r\n    reconnectTries: Number.MAX_VALUE, // Never stop trying to reconnect\r\n    reconnectInterval: 1000, // Reconnect every 500ms\r\n    poolSize: 10 // Maintain up to 10 socket connections\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  // Connect connection with MongoDB Database\r\n  connectDB: function() {\r\n    mongoose.connect(\r\n      this.database,\r\n      this.options\r\n    );\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  // Disconnect connection with MongoDB Database\r\n  disconnectDB: function() {\r\n    mongoose.disconnect(this.database);\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n// on mongo connection open event print a console statement\r\nmongoose.connection.on(\"open\", function() {\r\n  console.log(\"Connected to Database (MongoDB) \");\r\n});\r\n\r\n// on mongo connection error event\r\nmongoose.connection.on(\"error\", function() {\r\n  console.log(\"error in Database (MongoDB) connections\");\r\n});\r\n\r\n// on mongo connection disconnected event\r\nmongoose.connection.on(\"disconnected\", () => {\r\n  console.log(\"Mongoose default connection disconnected\");\r\n});\r\n\r\n//listen for SIGINT event(generated with <Ctrl>+C in the terminal) and close db connection on that event\r\nprocess.on(\"SIGINT\", () => {\r\n  mongoose.connection.close(() => {\r\n    console.log(\"Mongoose disconnected through app termination\");\r\n    process.exit(0);\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then my main server.js / index.js file will have this small graceful shutdown code. Where I will listen for `SIGINT` event(generated with <Ctrl>+C in the terminal) and close db connection on that event\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst config = require(\"./config/config\");\r\n\r\nprocess.on(\"SIGINT\", () => {\r\n  config.disconnectDB();\r\n  process.exit(0);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\n\r\n1> [https://blog.risingstack.com/graceful-shutdown-node-js-kubernetes/](https://blog.risingstack.com/graceful-shutdown-node-js-kubernetes/)\r\n\r\n2> [https://hackernoon.com/graceful-shutdown-in-nodejs-2f8f59d1c357](https://hackernoon.com/graceful-shutdown-in-nodejs-2f8f59d1c357)\r\n"

Basically the server consists of one thread processing one event after another.\r\n\r\nA new request coming in is one kind of event. The server starts processing it and when there is a blocking IO operation, it does not wait until it completes and instead registers a callback function. The server then immediately starts to process another event (maybe another request). When the IO operation is finished, that is another kind of event, and the server will process it (i.e. continue working on the request) by executing the callback as soon as it has time.\r\n\r\nSo the server never needs to create additional threads or switch between threads, which means it has very little overhead. If you want to make full use of multiple hardware cores, you just start multiple instances of node.js\r\n\r\nNode JS Platform does not follow Request/Response Multi-Threaded Stateless Model. It follows Single Threaded with Event Loop Model. Node JS Processing model mainly based on Javascript Event based model with Javascript callback mechanism.\r\n\r\n**Single Threaded Event Loop Model Processing Steps:**\r\n\r\n- Clients Send request to Web Server.\r\n- Node JS Web Server internally maintains a Limited Thread pool to provide services to the Client Requests.\r\n- Node JS Web Server receives those requests and places them into a Queue. It is known as “Event Queue”.\r\n- Node JS Web Server internally has a Component, known as “Event Loop”. Why it got this name is that it uses indefinite loop to receive requests and process them.\r\n- Event Loop uses Single Thread only. It is main heart of Node JS Platform Processing Model.\r\n- Even Loop checks any Client Request is placed in Event Queue. If no, then wait for incoming requests for indefinitely.\r\n- If yes, then pick up one Client Request from Event Queue\r\n  - Starts process that Client Request\r\n  - If that Client Request Does Not requires any Blocking IO Operations, then process everything, prepare response and send it back to client.\r\n  - If that Client Request requires some Blocking IO Operations like interacting with Database, File System, External Services then it will follow different approach\r\n    - Checks Threads availability from Internal Thread Pool\r\n    - Picks up one Thread and assign this Client Request to that thread.\r\n    - That Thread is responsible for taking that request, process it, perform Blocking IO operations, prepare response and send it back to the Event Loop\r\n    - Event Loop in turn, sends that Response to the respective Client.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">\r\n    <b><a href=\"#\">↥ back to top</a></b>\r\n</div>\r\n"

This is often used to send information that can be verified and trusted by means of a digital signature.\r\n\r\nThe JWT Claims Set represents a compact URL-safe JSON object, that is base64url encoded and digitally signed and/or encrypted. The JSON object consists of zero or more name/value pairs (or members), where the names are strings and the values are arbitrary JSON values. These members are the claims represented by the JWT.\r\n\r\n**It is  Stateless**: All the information needed to complete a particular request is sent along with it, including an Authorization HTTP header which contains our JWT which serves as an ‘identity object.’ Since the payload contains all the required information for us to authenticate the user, we can avoid making repeated calls to our database.\r\n\r\n**JSON Web Token is NOT Encrypted**: As demonstrated in the previous steps, the data inside a JWT is encoded and signed, not encrypted. The purpose of encoding data is to transform the data’s structure. Signing data allows the data receiver to verify the authenticity of the source of the data. So encoding and signing data does NOT secure the data. On the other hand, the main purpose of encryption is to secure the data and to prevent unauthorized access. While a JWT’s signature prevents malicious parties from tampering with it, the token’s header is only Base64 encoded. When dealing with confidential identifiers in your tokens, you should encrypt your tokens using AES.\r\n\r\nJWT are \"signed\" and therefore its contents are protected from tampering: you cannot change its contents without invalidating them.\r\n\r\nYou can optionally \"encrypt\" the contents and therefore turn them visible only to issuer (the entity creating the token) and the consumer (the entity that is destined to use its contents after verification).\r\n\r\n**To encrypt** a JWT for a given recipient you need to know their public RSA key. Decryption happens with the private RSA key, which the recipient must keep secure at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n1> Basic steps of token flow in JWT\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.jscrambler.com/implementing-jwt-using-passport/\r\n\r\nA> Client makes a request once by sending their login credentials and password\r\n\r\n### B> When the user logs in, the backend creates a signed token and returns it in response. That is, Server validates the credentials and, if everything is right, it returns to the client a JSON with a token that encodes data from a user logged into the system;\r\n\r\n### C> Client, after receiving this token, can store it the way it wants, whether via LocalStorage, Cookie or other client-side storage mechanisms;\r\nEvery time the client accesses a route that requires authentication, it will only send this token to the API to authenticate and release consumption data;\r\n\r\nD> Server always validate this token to allow or block a client request.\r\n\r\n2> https://medium.com/vandium-software/5-easy-steps-to-understanding-json-web-tokens-jwt-1164c0adfcec - GREAT article\r\n\r\nThe typical entities are the user, the application server, and the authentication server. The authentication server will provide the JWT to the user.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the user first signs into the authentication server using the authentication server’s login system (e.g. username and password, Facebook login, Google login, etc).\r\n\r\n### But instead of saving the user data, the authentication server, then creates the JWT and sends it to the user.\r\n\r\nWhen the user makes API calls to the application, the user passes the JWT along with the API call. In this setup, the application server would be configured to verify that the incoming JWT are created by the authentication server. So, the application can use the attached JWT to verify that the API call is coming from an authenticated user.\r\n\r\n### 2> method signature - jwt.sign(payload, secretOrPrivateKey, [options, callback])\r\n\r\npayload - this will include some user info, because this token is gonna decode in the server and the server needs to know what user it is. The payload component of the JWT is the data that‘s stored inside the JWT (this data is also referred to as the “claims” of the JWT).\r\n\r\nsecretOrPrivateKey - secretOrPrivateKey is a string, buffer, or object containing either the secret for HMAC algorithms or the PEM encoded private key for RSA and ECDSA. In case of a private key with passphrase an object { key, passphrase } can be used (based on crypto documentation), in this case be sure you pass the algorithm option.\r\n\r\n3> https://github.com/dwyl/learn-json-web-tokens\r\n\r\nWhat does a JWT Look Like?\r\nTokens are a string of \"url safe\" characters which encode information. Tokens have three components (separated by periods) (shown here on multiple lines for readability but used as a single string of text)\r\n\r\neyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9           // header\r\n.eyJrZXkiOiJ2YWwiLCJpYXQiOjE0MjI2MDU0NDV9      // payload\r\n.eUiabuiKv-8PYk2AkGY4Fb5KMZeorYBLw261JPQD5lM   // signature\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1. Header\r\nThe first part of a JWT is an encoded string representation of a simple JavaScript object which describes the token along with the hashing algorithm used. Basically contains information about how the JWT signature should be computed. The header is a JSON object in the following format:\r\n\r\n{\r\n    \"typ\": \"JWT\",\r\n    \"alg\": \"HS256\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n### 2. Payload\r\nThe second part of the JWT forms the core of the token. Payload length is proportional to the amount of data you store in the JWT. General rule of thumb is: store the bare minimum in the JWT.\r\n\r\n### 3. Signature\r\nThe third, and final, part of the JWT is a signature generated based on the header (part one) and the body (part two) and will be used to verify that the JWT is valid.\r\n\r\nThe signature is computed using the following pseudo code (https://medium.com/vandium-software/5-easy-steps-to-understanding-json-web-tokens-jwt-1164c0adfcec) :\r\n\r\n```js\r\ndata = base64urlEncode( header ) + “.” + base64urlEncode( payload )\r\nsignature = Hash( data, secret );\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat this algorithm does is base64url encodes the header and the payload created in steps 1 and 2. The algorithm then joins the resulting encoded strings together with a period (.) in between them. In our pseudo code, this joined string is assigned to data. To get the JWT signature, the data string is hashed with the secret key using the hashing algorithm specified in the JWT header.\r\n\r\nRemembering the header.payload.signature structure of the JWT, we simply need to combine the components, with periods (.) separating them.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4> generate the JWT\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction generateToken(req){\r\n  var token = jwt.sign({\r\n    auth:  'magic',\r\n    agent: req.headers['user-agent'],\r\n    exp:   Math.floor(new Date().getTime()/1000) + 7*24*60*60; // Note: in seconds!\r\n  }, secret);  // secret is defined in the environment variable JWT_SECRET\r\n  return token;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# 5> How does JWT protect our data?\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand that the purpose of using JWT is NOT to hide or obscure data in any way. The reason why JWT are used is to prove that the sent data was actually created by an authentic source.\r\n\r\n## As demonstrated in the previous steps, the data inside a JWT is encoded and signed, not encrypted. The purpose of encoding data is to transform the data’s structure. Signing data allows the data receiver to verify the authenticity of the source of the data. So encoding and signing data does NOT secure the data.\r\n\r\n# Extracting the JWT from the request\r\n\r\n1> https://github.com/themikenicholson/passport-jwt#extracting-the-jwt-from-the-request\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways the JWT may be included in a request. In order to remain as flexible as possible the JWT is parsed from the request by a user-supplied callback passed in as the jwtFromRequest parameter. This callback, from now on referred to as an extractor, accepts a request object as an argument and returns the encoded JWT string or null.\r\n\r\nA number of extractor factory functions are provided in passport-jwt.ExtractJwt. These factory functions return a new extractor configured with the given parameters. fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken() is one suct function that I am using here, as my scheme here was ‘bearer’ as stated in my user.js routes file.\r\n\r\nfromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken() creates a new extractor that looks for the JWT in the authorization header with the scheme 'bearer'\r\n\r\n#### Some good resources on this topic\r\n\r\n - https://medium.com/vandium-software/5-easy-steps-to-understanding-json-web-tokens-jwt-1164c0adfcec\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "### First note, in a typical node app, the token is generated with jsonwebtoken npm package using jwt.sign() function in the auth.js backend route or controller. So within the router.post('/login', cb) , I will have a chunk of code like below.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar token = jwt.sign(\r\n  {\r\n    username: user.username,\r\n    id: user._id,\r\n    employerType: user.employerType\r\n  },\r\n  settings.secret,\r\n  {\r\n    expiresIn: \"15s\"\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n// return the information including token as JSON and the imageUrl as an additional data-point so I can get it in the front end to be renderer in the header for the logged-in user\r\n\r\nres.json({\r\n  success: true,\r\n  token: \"JWT \" + token,\r\n  imageUrl: user.images,\r\n  username: user.name\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the way this token is saved in the localStroge in the frontend is within my Login.js react component (or similar file in whatever frontend technology I am using) file in React, i.e. the file that creates a POST request to the backend's auth.js's login route ('/login') like below\r\n\r\n```js\r\naxios.post(\"/api/auth/login\", { username, password }).then(result => {\r\n  localStorage.setItem(\"user\", JSON.stringify(result.data));\r\n\r\n  this.setState(() => ({\r\n    message: \"\",\r\n    redirectToReferrer: true\r\n  }));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### JWT sessionStorage and localStorage Security\r\n\r\nWeb Storage (localStorage/sessionStorage) is accessible through JavaScript on the same domain. This means that any JavaScript running on your site will have access to web storage, and because of this can be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS, in a nutshell, is a type of vulnerability where an attacker can inject JavaScript that will run on your page. Basic XSS attacks attempt to inject JavaScript through form inputs, where the attacker puts <script>alert('You are Hacked');</script> into a form to see if it is run by the browser and can be viewed by other users.\r\n\r\nIf your website contains any third party JavaScript code included from a source outside your domain:\r\n\r\nLinks to bootstrap\r\nLinks to jQuery\r\nLinks to Vue, React, Angular, etc.\r\nLinks to any ad network code\r\nLinks to Google Analytics\r\nLinks to any tracking code\r\nThen you are currently at risk for having an attacker run JavaScript on your website. Let’s say your website has the following script tag embedded inside it:\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://awesomejslibrary.com/minified.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nIn this case, if awesomejslibrary.com is compromised and their minified.js script gets altered to:\r\n\r\nLoop through all data in local storage\r\nSend it to an API built to collect stolen information\r\n… then you are completely screwed. In this situation the attacker would have easily been able to compromise anything you had stored in local storage and you would never notice.\r\n\r\n### Overall using localstorage for the JWT token is acceptable, as long as we also do the following on the HTTP level:\r\n\r\nEnsure the entire site was served over HTTPS\r\nWe use the Angular CLI. It turns out that, despite the tree shaking provided by WebPack, unused variables still show up in the compiled source code, for example localhost:4200\r\nAdd the X-Frame-Options header to every HTTP response, and set it to Deny\r\nSet X-XSS-Protection to 1\r\nSet X-Content-Type-Options to nosniff\r\nMake sure Content-Security-Policy is restricted to your own domain name, and any CDN's you may be pulling scripts in from\r\nSet Referrer-Policy to same-origin\r\nLimit the JWT expiry on Auth0 to 1 hour\r\n\r\n### What to Use Instead of Local Storage\r\n\r\n#### If you need to store sensitive data, you should always use a server-side session. Sensitive data includes:\r\n\r\nUser IDs\r\nSession IDs\r\nJWTs\r\nPersonal information\r\nCredit card information\r\nAPI keys\r\nAnd anything else you wouldn’t want to publicly share on Facebook\r\nIf you need to store sensitive data, here’s how to do it:\r\n\r\n#### When a user logs into your website, create a session identifier for them and store it in a cryptographically signed cookie. If you’re using a web framework, look up “how to create a user session using cookies” and follow that guide.\r\n\r\n#### Make sure that whatever cookie library your web framework uses is setting the httpOnly cookie flag. This flag makes it impossible for a browser to read any cookies, which is required in order to safely use server-side sessions with cookies. Read Jeff Atwood’s article for more information. He’s the man.\r\n\r\n#### Make sure that your cookie library also sets the SameSite=strict cookie flag (to prevent CSRF attacks), as well as the secure=true flag (to ensure cookies can only be set over an encrypted connection).\r\n\r\n#### Each time a user makes a request to your site, use their session ID (extracted from the cookie they send to you) to retrieve their account details from either a database or a cache (depending on how large your website is)\r\n\r\n#### Once you have the user’s account info pulled up and verified, feel free to pull any associated sensitive data along with it\r\n\r\nThis pattern is simple, straightforward, and most importantly: secure. And yes, you can most definitely scale up a large website using this pattern.\r\n\r\n### Non-String Data\r\n\r\nIf you need to store data in the browser that isn’t sensitive and isn’t purely string data, the best option for you is IndexedDB. It’s an API that lets you work with a database-esque object store in the browser.\r\n\r\nWhat’s great about IndexedDB is that you can use it to store typed information: integers, floats, etc. You can also define primary keys, handle indexing, and create transactions to prevent data integrity issues.\r\n\r\n### Offline Data\r\n\r\nIf you need your app to run offline, your best option is to use a combination of IndexedDB (above) along with the Cache API (which is a part of Service Workers).\r\n\r\nThe Cache API allows you to cache network resources that your app needs to load.\r\n\r\n#### Further reading\r\n\r\n1> [https://www.rdegges.com/2018/please-stop-using-local-storage/](https://www.rdegges.com/2018/please-stop-using-local-storage/)\r\n"

Technologies like IndexedDB and localStorage have provided this functionality to web developers, but they are not without their limitations.\r\n\r\nThe localStorage API is really simple to use, but you can only store text data. This limitation can generally be overcome by storing other types of data as JSON strings, but this can be a pain as you have to encode/decode JSON every time you need to store or retrieve some data. Not to mention you still have a problem if you need to store Blobs or files. LocalStorage is also a synchronous API, which means that your app could hang while data is being stored or retrieved.\r\n\r\n## [Example of Localstorage](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/02/localforage-offline-storage-improved/)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n// Our config values we want to store offline.\r\nvar config = {\r\n    fullName: document.getElementById('name').getAttribute('value'),\r\n    userId: document.getElementById('id').getAttribute('value')\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Let's save it for the next time we load the app.\r\nlocalStorage.setItem('config', JSON.stringify(config));\r\n\r\n// The next time we load the app, we can do:\r\nvar config = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('config'));\r\n\r\n```\r\n### And now the localForage code for the above\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlocalForage Code\r\n// Save our users.\r\nvar users = [ {id: 1, fullName: 'Matt'}, {id: 2, fullName: 'Bob'} ];\r\nlocalForage.setItem('users', users, function(result) {\r\n    console.log(result);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Issues with localStorage:\r\n\r\n**1>** It’s synchronous. We wait until the data has been read from the disk and parsed, regardless of how large it might be. This slows down our app’s responsiveness. This is especially bad on mobile devices; the main thread is halted until the data is fetched, making your app seem slow and even unresponsive.\r\n\r\n**2>** It only supports strings. Notice how we had to use JSON.parse and JSON.stringify? That’s because localStorage only supports values that are JavaScript strings. No numbers, booleans, Blobs, etc. This makes storing numbers or arrays annoying, but effectively makes storing Blobs impossible (or at least VERY annoying and slow).\r\n\r\nIndexedDB, on the other hand, is an asynchronous API that includes great support for a wide range of data types, but the API itself is considerably more complex to use.\r\n\r\nEnter localForage, a JavaScript library that provides the ease of use of localStorage with all the advanced features of IndexedDB.\r\n\r\nThe localForage JavaScript library was developed by the good folks at Mozilla to provide a simple storage API that has all the capabilities of more complex APIs like IndexedDB, but without the steep learning curve.\r\n\r\n### Behind the scenes, localForage uses native browser technologies like IndexedDB, WebSQL, and localStorage to actually store data. The localForage API sits on top of this datastore layer and provides a number of methods that can be used for managing data.\r\n\r\n### The other main benefit of using localForage is that you don’t have to convert your data structures to JSON in order to save them in the datastore. If the underlying datastore technology (read: localStorage) doesn’t support the data type you provide, then localForage will take care of the JSON wizardry for you so you can just focus on building your app’s functionality.\r\n\r\n## Storing Data\r\n\r\nThe localForage library will automatically set up a datastore using the best storage technology that’s available in the user’s browser.\r\n\r\nAs with localStorage, the data is stored using key/value pairs. The setItem method is responsible for saving data in the datastore.\r\n\r\n``localforage.setItem('key', 'value', callbackFunction);``\r\n\r\nThe value here can be any kind of data you want: a string, number, object, or even a file.\r\n\r\nIf the key already exists in the datastore, the existing value will simple be overwritten.\r\n\r\n### Unlike with localStorage, the localForage API is asynchronous and therefore you shouldn’t expect the setItem method to return a value. Instead, you can pass a callback function to the setItem method. This callback function will be executed once the data has been stored and will be passed the value that was saved in the datastore.\r\n\r\nNote: The amount of storage space accessible to localForage is governed by the underlying datastore technology that’s being used. For localStorage, the general limit is 5MB, although this may vary among browsers. More space is available when IndexedDB is being used, but the user may be prompted to approve additional quota if your app needs to store large amounts of data.\r\n\r\n## Retrieving Data\r\nData can be retrieved from the datastore using the getItem method. You should pass in the key of the item you wish to retrieve, as well as a callback function that will be passed the value for the item.\r\n\r\n``localforage.getItem('key', callbackFunction);``\r\n\r\nIf the specified key doesn’t exist in the datastore, the callback function will be passed null.\r\n\r\n## Deleting Data\r\n\r\nIf you want to delete some data, you can use the removeItem method. Pass in the key of the item you wish to delete and a callback function.\r\n\r\n``localforage.removeItem('key', callbackFunction);``\r\n\r\n## Clearing The Datastore\r\n\r\nYou can remove all the data from the datastore using the clear method.\r\n\r\n``localforage.clear(callbackFunction);``\r\n\r\nAgain, this method can be passed a callback function that will be executed when the operation has completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### More Reading\r\n\r\n1> [http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/using-localforage-offline-data-storage](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/using-localforage-offline-data-storage)\r\n\r\n2> [https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/02/localforage-offline-storage-improved/](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/02/localforage-offline-storage-improved/)\r\n\r\n3> [My Implemented code with async-await in my To-Do kind of app for checingin/uncheking items before trave](https://github.com/rohan-paul/check-pack-items-before-travel/tree/master/src/lib/api.js)"

        "content": "Passport is a framework, and a Node.js middleware, that is extremely flexible and modular. It allows you to work with the main authentication strategies: Basic & Digest, OpenID, OAuth, OAuth 2.0 and JWT. And also allows you to work with external services authentication, such as Facebook, Google+, Twitter and more. Per its official site, there is a list with +300 authentication strategies, created and maintained by 3rd-party.\r\n\r\n### First note the actual implemented code and flow, in a typical node app, the token is generated with jsonwebtoken npm package using jwt.sign() function in the auth.js backend route or controller. Like below\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar token = jwt.sign(\r\n  {\r\n    username: user.username,\r\n    id: user._id,\r\n    employerType: user.employerType\r\n  },\r\n  settings.secret,\r\n  {\r\n    expiresIn: \"15s\"\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n// return the information including token as JSON and the imageUrl as an additional data-point so I can get it in the front end to be renderer in the header for the logged-in user\r\n\r\nres.json({\r\n  success: true,\r\n  token: \"JWT \" + token,\r\n  imageUrl: user.images,\r\n  username: user.name\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the way this token is saved in the localStroge in the frontend is within Login.js file in React, i.e. the file that creates a POST request to the backend's auth.js's login route ('/login') like below\r\n\r\n```js\r\naxios.post(\"/api/auth/login\", { username, password }).then(result => {\r\n  localStorage.setItem(\"user\", JSON.stringify(result.data));\r\n\r\n  this.setState(() => ({\r\n    message: \"\",\r\n    redirectToReferrer: true\r\n  }));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### So Passport is not for any specific method of authentication, the method for authentication like OAuth, JWT is implemented in Passport by Strategy pattern, so it means that you can swap the authentication mechanism without affecting other parts of your application.\r\n\r\n#### Passport JWT (passport-jwt) is only for authenticating requests. And I will need another tool to actually generate a token, and for which job I use jsonwebtoken.\r\n\r\n#### The JWT token, which you generate in the backend within the auth route (when user sends a POST request to '/login' route in the backend) and return to whatever original client-route made the request. So, the backend creates a signed token and returns it in response. The client saves the token ( the one returned by backend in response ) locally (typically in localStorage)\r\n\r\n#### Now when any protected-client route makes a request, this token needs to be present in the header (\"Authorization: JWT eyJ0eXAiO...\") on all subsequent requests, that for all subsequent requst to a protected-route, which needs authentication. Passwort-jwt in the backend for that specific protected-route, checks this auth header and verifies it's validity. If it is invalid, it returns a 401, otherwise it populate your req.user.\r\n\r\n## The actual implementation steps - How passport validation work-flow works (passport-jwt strategy and jsonwebtoken)\r\n\r\n**1> passport.js** works with the concept of strategies. They basically are a middleware function that a requests runs through before getting to the actual route. If your defined authentication strategy fails, which means that the callback will be called with an error that is not null or false as the second argument, the route will not be called, but a 401 Unauthorized response will be sent.\r\n\r\n#### In this example I am using passport-jwt strategy and jsonwebtoken (its from my Developer-Profiler app(https://github.com/rohan-paul/Developer-Profile-App)).\r\n\r\n**2> passport-jwt**\r\n\r\nMy passport.js file below\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst opts = {};\r\nopts.jwtFromRequest = ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken();\r\n/* The above is for Extracting the JWT from the request. The JWT is parsed from the request by a user-supplied callback passed in as the jwtFromRequest parameter. This callback, from now on referred to as an extractor, accepts a request object as an argument and returns the encoded JWT string or null.\r\nA number of extractor factory functions are provided in passport-jwt.ExtractJwt. These factory functions return a new extractor configured with the given parameters. fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken() is one such function, as my scheme here was ‘bearer’ as stated in my user.js routes file. */\r\n\r\nopts.secretOrKey = keys.secretOrKey;\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = passport => {\r\n  passport.use(\r\n    new JwtStrategy(opts, (jwt_payload, done) => {\r\n      // console.log(jwt_payload);\r\n      User.findById(jwt_payload.id)\r\n        .then(user => {\r\n          if (user) {\r\n            return done(null, user);\r\n          }\r\n          return done(null, false);\r\n        })\r\n        .catch(err => console.log(err));\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this strategy above, I assume that the client will send the JWT token in Authorization Header as a Bearer Token when logging in.\r\nServer validates user credentials and returns encrypted user object i.e **token**. Client can save token using cookie, local-storage, or other mechanism. Then on every user request it validates token and only on successful validation proceed with the request.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage of tokens is that we don’t have to lookup the token in a database on every api call as it contains all needed information in itself. This should help keeping the authentication process small. The biggest downside of that is the inability of revoking a token without having a whitelist or blacklist somewhere. This is the reason we keep the lifetime of the token small (like for example 120 minutes).\r\n\r\nThis passport middleware will be injected via passport.use(strategy) function. To finish, two functions will be included from Passport to be used on the application. They are the initialize() function which starts the Passport and authenticate() which is used to authenticate the access for a route.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/42306821/why-would-i-need-to-use-passport-package-with-jsonwebtoken-for-applying-token-ba\r\n\r\n### 3> Understanding the main function of official dox (https://github.com/themikenicholson/passport-jwt#configure-strategy)\r\n\r\n```js\r\npassport.use(\r\n  new JwtStrategy(opts, function(jwt_payload, done) {\r\n    User.findOne({ id: jwt_payload.sub }, function(err, user) {\r\n      if (err) {\r\n        return done(err, false);\r\n      }\r\n      if (user) {\r\n        return done(null, user);\r\n      } else {\r\n        return done(null, false);\r\n        // or you could create a new account\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n  })\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nA> In the above I pass-in a new instance of JwtStrategy and then pass in options and a callback.\r\n\r\nB> **'jwt_payload'** is an object literal containing the decoded JWT payload. Inside the callback the jwt_payload will contain all my user data, that I included in ../routes/api/users.js file\r\n[https://github.com/rohan-paul/Developer-Profile-App/blob/master/routes/api/users.js#L101](https://github.com/rohan-paul/Developer-Profile-App/blob/master/routes/api/users.js#L101)\r\n\r\n`const payload = { id: user.id, name: user.name, avatar: user.avatar };`\r\n\r\nSo, this payload will have the attribute id that will be a user id to be used as argument to search a user in the database.\r\n\r\nC> Once I do that, I want to find that user\r\n\r\nD> 'done' is a passport error-first callback accepting arguments done(error, user, info)\r\n\r\n### 2-nd Implemented project, where also I am using passport (with jwt strategy) and jsonwebtoken\r\n\r\n/home/paul/codes-Lap/React/Volteo/AP-Ports/frontend-portal-MY-WORK-push-to-github/Phase-2/server/config/passport.js\r\n\r\nHere's my passport.js file\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = function(passport) {\r\n  var opts = {};\r\n  opts.jwtFromRequest = ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderWithScheme(\"jwt\");\r\n  opts.secretOrKey = settings.secret;\r\n  passport.use(\r\n    new JwtStrategy(opts, function(jwt_payload, done) {\r\n      console.log(\"payload received\", jwt_payload);\r\n      // Now the usual database call\r\n      User.findOne({ _id: jwt_payload.id }, function(err, user) {\r\n        if (err) {\r\n          return done(err, false);\r\n        }\r\n        if (user) {\r\n          done(null, user);\r\n        } else {\r\n          done(null, false);\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in my ..server/routes/auth.js for the router.post('/login) - I had the below\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar token = jwt.sign(\r\n  {\r\n    username: user.username,\r\n    id: user._id,\r\n    employerType: user.employerType\r\n  },\r\n  settings.secret,\r\n  {\r\n    expiresIn: \"4h\"\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### To see the actual contents of the jwt_payload - put this < console.log(\"payload received\", jwt_payload) > inside the passport.js file as above.\r\n\r\nNow, after using any protected route (for example adding a new tidal data under /tidal/create) route (which had `passport.authenticate` as the middleware) I will get the following printed in Terminal (which are actual user's email, the saved mongo \\_id and employer type)\r\n\r\n```js\r\npayload received { username: 'actual_user-email@gmail.com',\r\n   id: '664633411681589161646',\r\n   employerType: 'port',\r\n   iat: 1544424322,\r\n   exp: 1544438722 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Then the below is how, the middleware check is implemented in the backend protected route for adding a new tidal data at \"/createtide\" route in the backend.\r\n\r\n### The getToken() function is merely for getting the actual token from headers so I can check the existence of a token) - which is mainly required in the frontend to conditionally show \"Login\" or \"Logout\" button. And in the backend its just another layer of check (but not really required)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// route to Add a new Tidal data ( Protected routes )\r\nrouter.post(\r\n  \"/createtide\",\r\n  passport.authenticate(\"jwt\", { session: false }),\r\n  (req, res) => {\r\n    var token = getToken(req.headers);\r\n    if (token) {\r\n      var tide = new Tide(req.body);\r\n      tide.save(function(err, newTide) {\r\n        if (err) throw err;\r\n        res.status(200).send(newTide);\r\n      });\r\n    } else {\r\n      return res.status(403).send({ success: false, msg: \"Unauthorized.\" });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3-rd Implemented project - Herer, I got passport-local strategy (as opposed to 'jwt')- (https://github.com/rohan-paul/SignUp-Form-with-Passport) app. For more details see - https://www.sitepoint.com/local-authentication-using-passport-node-js/\r\n\r\n**In serializeUser** passport attaches the profile information to req.user. This occurs as a direct result of the serializeUser() and deserializeUser() functions. - https://hackernoon.com/passportjs-the-confusing-parts-explained-edca874ebead\r\n\r\n**In deserializeUser()**, the first argument is an id which is the same id that was passed in done(null, user.id) of serializeUser(). deserializeUser() then makes a request to our DB to find the full profile information for the user and then calls done(null, user). This is where the user profile is attached to the request handler at req.user. Then finally after all this occurs, the user is routed back to the /login/google/return route handler where we can finally access the user profile information on req.user. - https://hackernoon.com/passportjs-the-confusing-parts-explained-edca874ebead\r\n\r\n#### General Resources to refer\r\n\r\n1> [https://jonathanmh.com/express-passport-json-web-token-jwt-authentication-beginners/](https://jonathanmh.com/express-passport-json-web-token-jwt-authentication-beginners/)\r\n"

        "content": "## The very basic steps of express-session and cookie-based session management\r\n\r\nThe first time a browser makes a request to our server, express session\r\n\r\ngenerates a unique session id\r\n2. saves that session id in a session cookie and passes this back to the browser.\r\n\r\n3. creates an empty session object, as req.session.\r\n\r\n4. saves the session object to the database.\r\n\r\nNow if the same browser makes another request, the browser sends that earlier saved cookie that contains our session id, and boom, that’s the caller id. Express session knows that browser has sent requests before.\r\n\r\n=================================================\r\n\r\n## What is a session?\r\n\r\nA session is a place to store data that you want have access to, across the requests between client and server. Each user that visits your website has a unique session.  You can use sessions to store and access user data as they browse your application. Sessions are integral to web application development because they allow the application to store state. Based on what action a user took on Page A, we can show a different Page B. Without them, applications would be stateless, and not very useful.\r\n\r\nSessions can store their information in different ways. The popular ways to store session data is:\r\n\r\n- In application memory\r\n- In a cookie\r\n- In a memory cache\r\n- In a database\r\n\r\n#### The module like express-session will provide you with a nice API to work with sessions (letting you get & set data to the session), but under the hood, it will save and retrieve this data using a cookie.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1. Storing Session Data in Application Memory\r\n\r\nOne way to store session data is in Application memory. This is often the simplest way, but not used in production.\r\n\r\nStoring session data in application memory essentially means that the data is stored for the lifetime of your application runtime. If your web application server crashes or is stopped, all session data is removed. It also causes memory leaks. As your application stays running, more and more memory is used, until your app runs out of memory.\r\n\r\n### 2. Storing Session Data in Cookies\r\n\r\nA cookie is usually a small piece of data that gets sent between a web server to your web browser. It allows the server to store information relevant to a specific user.\r\n\r\nOne common use for cookies is to store session data. This works in the following way.\r\n\r\nThe server issues a cookie that gets sent to the web browser and stored for a period of time (called the expiration time).\r\nWhen a user makes a subsequent request to the web server, this cookie gets sent along with the request, and the server can read the information that is in it.\r\nThe server can manipulate the cookie if it needs to, and then sends it back to the browser.\r\nUntil the cookie expires, every time you make a request, your browser will send the cookies back to the server.\r\n\r\n#### modules like express-session will provide you with a nice API to work with sessions (letting you get & set data to the session), but under the hood, it will save and retrieve this data using a cookie.\r\n\r\nExpress-session also offers ways to secure your cookies to ensure that the information inside your application cookies are not exposed.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/session#cookiesecure  - Please note that secure: true is a recommended option. However, it requires an https-enabled website, i.e., HTTPS is necessary for secure cookies. If secure is set, and you access your site over HTTP, the cookie will not be set. If you have your node.js behind a proxy and are using secure: true, you need to set \"trust proxy\" in express:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar app = express()\r\napp.set('trust proxy', 1) // trust first proxy\r\napp.use(session({\r\n  secret: 'keyboard cat',\r\n  resave: false,\r\n  saveUninitialized: true,\r\n  cookie: { secure: true }\r\n}))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Some drawbacks with cookies:\r\n\r\nThey can only store small bits of data, about 4KB usually.\r\nThey are sent in every request, and if you store a bunch of data in a cookie, it will increase the size of the requests, which will slow down your site’s performance.\r\nIf an attacker figures out how your cookies are encrypted (your secret key), then your cookies will be compromised. Attackers will then be able to read the data that is stored in the cookies, which can be sensitive user data.\r\n\r\n### 3. Storing Session Data in a Memory Cache\r\n\r\nA Memory Cache is a place where small chunks of key-value data can be stored. Popular examples of memory caches that are used to store session information are Redis and Memcached.\r\n\r\n#### When storing session data in a memory cache, the server will still use a cookie, but the cookie will only contain a unique sessionId. This sessionId will be used by the server to perform a lookup against the store.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen using a memory cache, your cookie only contains a session ID. This removes the risk of private user information being exposed in the cookie.\r\n\r\n#### There are some other benefits to using a memory cache to store session information.\r\n\r\nThey are normally key-value based and are very quick to perform lookups.\r\nThey normally are decoupled from your application server. This decoupling reduces dependencies.\r\nA single memory store can serve many applications.\r\nThey automatically manage memory by removing old session data.\r\n\r\n#### However, there are some downsides to them as well:\r\n\r\nThey are another server to set up and manage.\r\nThey may be overkill for small applications. Normally database stores (which we will cover next), or cookies will do the job as well.\r\nThere’s no good way to reset the cache without removing all the sessions stored inside it.\r\n\r\n### 4. Storing Session Data in a Database\r\n\r\nLastly, let’s talk about storing session data in a traditional database, like MySQL or PostgreSQL. For most cases, this works in a very similar way to storing session data in a memory store.\r\n\r\nThe session cookie still contains a sessionId. In this case, it will map to the primary key of the Session table on the database.\r\n\r\n**Some drawback of storing session in database**\r\n\r\nRetrieving data from a database is slower than a memory cache because the data is stored on disk, not on memory. You’ll be hitting your database a lot when you store your sessions there.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you have to completely manage old sessions yourself. If you don’t get rid of old sessions, your database will be filled with thousands of unused rows.\r\n\r\n\r\n### We use sessions to maintain state between user requests and we use cookies to transport the session ID between those requests.\r\n\r\nEvery user interaction with your application is an isolated and individual request and response. The need to persist information between requests is vital for maintaining the ultimate experience for the user.\r\n\r\nAfter an user has authenticated, as a developer I have to retain various personalized user information that is associated with a session as well.\r\n\r\nSo I have to securely set up sessions in my application to mitigate risks such as session hijacking. For that I have to obfuscate session ID’s, enforce a time-to-live in my sessions, set up secure cookies for transporting sessions, and finally the importance and role of Transport Layer Security (TLS) when it comes to using sessions.\r\n\r\n[express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) (https://github.com/expressjs/session ) - A very popular session module that has been highly vetted by the community and constantly improved.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst session = require('express-session')\r\nconst dbConnection = require('./database')\r\nconst MongoStore = require('connect-mongo')(session)\r\n\r\napp.use(\r\n\tsession({\r\n\t\tsecret: 'fraggle-rock', //pick a random string to make the hash that is generated secure\r\n\t\tstore: new MongoStore({ mongooseConnection: dbConnection }),\r\n\t\tresave: false, //required\r\n\t\tsaveUninitialized: false //required\r\n\t})\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What’s Going On Here\r\n\r\nWe're importing the [session function](https://github.com/expressjs/session/blob/master/session/session.js#L24) from the express-session NPM module and passing the session function a configuration object to set properties inside the object passed to express-session. Note **express-session**, requires an object as an argument to initialize it.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Secret**. Required option. This is a value used in the signing of the session ID cookie, that is stored in the cookie.\r\n\r\nThis can be either a string for a single secret, or an array of multiple secrets. If an array of secrets is provided, only the first element will be used to sign the session ID cookie, while all the elements will be considered when verifying the signature in requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Store**. I’m using MongoDB as my backend, and I want to persist the application sessions in my database, so I am using the **connect-mongo** NPM module and setting the session store value to an instance of this module. However, you might be using a different backend, so your store option could be different. The default for **store** is express-session is an in-memory storage. That is, it defaults to a new **MemoryStore** instance. ( **MemoryStore** is the default memory where express-session stores cookie data  ). Note - express-session by default uses a MemoryStore (in-memory key-value store for storing session data) implementation that is only designed for development environments, but cant scale in production, as after few user logins it can no more handle all those session data and will crash wiping out all session data.\r\n\r\n**Cookie**. This determines the behavior of the HTTP cookie that stores the session ID.\r\n\r\n**resave** - Forces the session to be saved back to the session store, even if the session was never modified during the request. Depending on your store this may be necessary, but it can also create race conditions where a client makes two parallel requests to your server and changes made to the session in one request may get overwritten when the other request ends, even if it made no changes (this behavior also depends on what store you're using).\r\nSo, resave: false will not resave to the session store unless the session is modified. Modified means adding a property to req.session or changing a variable value.\r\n\r\n\r\nTypically, you'll want false.\r\n\r\nHow do I know if this is necessary for my store? The best way to know is to check with your store if it implements the touch method. If it does, then you can safely set resave: false. If it does not implement the touch method and your store sets an expiration date on stored sessions, then you likely need resave: true.\r\n\r\n**saveUninitialized**\r\nForces a session that is \"uninitialized\" to be saved to the store. A session is uninitialized when it is new but not modified. Choosing false is useful for implementing login sessions, reducing server storage usage, or complying with laws that require permission before setting a cookie. Choosing false will also help with race conditions where a client makes multiple parallel requests without a session.\r\n\r\nSo, saveUninitialized: false: An uninitialized session is an unmodified one. When set to false, the session won’t be saved unless we modify it. It also won’t send the id back to the browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Good resources\r\n - https://dzone.com/articles/securing-nodejs-managing-sessions-in-expressjs\r\n\r\n - https://nodewebapps.com/2017/06/18/how-do-nodejs-sessions-work/"

        "content": "If you’ll recall, Express works with a request-response cycle in which callback functions are tied to specific routes and have access to request and response objects, like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.get('/', (request, response) => {\r\n  // index logic\r\n});\r\n```\r\nNow let’s go over the building blocks for sessions and authentication, one by one.\r\n\r\n#### express-session\r\n\r\nexpress-session is an Express middleware used for persisting sessions across stateless HTTP requests. It expands on some key objects provided by both Express and Node.js.\r\n\r\n#### Overview\r\n\r\nSessions are used for storing data about a user and presenting dynamic data based on a user’s identity. They rely upon saving session data to a cookie that is sent to the user’s browser and then received back in future user requests.\r\n\r\nThis module expands the Express request object with the session property (among other things), which itself is an object that can be used by other middleware.\r\n\r\nBy default it uses a MemoryStore, an in-memory key-value database not intended for production use, to store the session data. But you can and should plug in another memory store middleware when deploying a serious product.\r\n\r\nIt creates a session for every user by generating a special ID that serves as a unique key for the session data. This ID is stored and sent in a cookie, while the session data is saved in a memory store or cache.\r\n\r\nThis way cookies are very lightweight while more costly lookups to the database are reduced since the session object containing all the session data is stored in-memory.\r\n\r\nYou can view the value of this ID in action by logging request.sessionID when inside an Express route callback.\r\n\r\n#### Conceptual Workflow\r\n\r\nThe way you would usually provide information for a session is through an HTML form element in a web page. You would “log in” a user through a POST request to your web server containing username and password values.\r\n\r\nYour login page form would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<form action=\"/login\" method=\"POST\">\r\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\">\r\n  <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\">\r\n  <input type=\"submit\">\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\nAnd the route on your app.js would be something close to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\napp.post('/login', (request, response) => {\r\n  // login logic goes here\r\n});\r\n```\r\nAt this point you would need to store the login information somewhere in order to create a user session. Passport does exactly this, but we’ll get into that later.\r\n\r\nLet’s understand what goes on once you use express-session in your project.\r\n\r\nWhen a new session is created for a user:\r\n\r\nA special ID is generated and the session object is appended to request.\r\n\r\nThe special ID is encrypted with a secret provided by the developer and is written to the HTTP response header as a cookie that eventually reaches the user’s browser.\r\n\r\nThe express-session module expands the standard response.end() method of the Node HTTP module, and ensures that the special ID and the session are saved to the memory store near the end of the request-response lifecycle.\r\n\r\nWhen a user is browsing our web site/web app under a session:\r\n\r\nThe browser sends the cookie containing the ID for the session as part of the HTTP request.\r\nexpress-session parses and decrypts the cookie.\r\nexpress-session reads the ID.\r\nexpress-session retrieves the session data from the store.\r\nexpress-session appends the session object as a property in the request object, restoring the stored session for the new request.\r\nPlugging It into Express\r\nIn app.js add the following require statement:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst session = require('express-session');\r\n\r\n// express-session must be used before passport\r\napp.use(session({\r\n    secret: 'Insert randomized text here',\r\n    resave: false,\r\n    saveUninitialized: false\r\n}));\r\n\r\n```\r\nNow a session (ID and object) will be created for every unique user across multiple HTTP requests.\r\n\r\nHowever, right now the session object is not storing any important information. That is where passport comes in to take advantage of this functionality for implementing user authentication.\r\n\r\nPassport is a module that provides and automates user authentication for Express. It is mostly used to support authentication sessions over HTTP.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\nIn app.js add the following require statement:\r\n\r\n``const passport = require('passport');``\r\n\r\nTo configure passport correctly, you need to provide three things:\r\n\r\nAn Authentication Strategy\r\nApplication Middleware\r\nSessions\r\n\r\npassport.authenticate() will call our ‘local’ auth strategy, so we need to configure passport to use that strategy. We can configure passport with passport.use(new strategyClass). Here we tell passport how the local strategy can be used to authenticate the user.\r\n\r\nInside the strategyClass declaration, we will take in the data from our POST request, use that to find the matching user in the database and check that the credentials match.\r\n\r\nAuthentication strategies are a way for passport to delegate authentication to other modular packages. For example, there are Node packages that provide passport authentication strategies for Facebook and Twitter, etc.\r\n\r\nFor our local use case, the strategy is provided by the passport-local package. Passport provides the use() function for plugging in the strategy (we’ll be doing that differently later), and it generally looks like this when using mongoose:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst passport = require('passport'),\r\n  LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;\r\n\r\npassport.use(new LocalStrategy(\r\n  function(username, password, done) {\r\n    User.findOne({ username: username }, function (err, user) {\r\n      if (err) { return done(err); }\r\n      if (!user) {\r\n        return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username.' });\r\n      }\r\n      if (!user.validPassword(password)) {\r\n        return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect password.' });\r\n      }\r\n      return done(null, user);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n));\r\n\r\n```\r\nNotice that the callback function provided to the LocalStrategy object is the one that contains the logic used to verify a user’s identity.\r\n\r\nThe verify callback must return a model of the user when the authentication is successful (the credentials are valid).\r\n\r\nIn our case it is a mongoose model of the User that will be returned.\r\n\r\nOnce a strategy has been supplied, the relevant middleware has to be configured with Express so our web server can use passport. In an app.js file, it generally looks like the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst session = require(\"express-session\");\r\n\r\napp.use(session({ secret: \"cats\" }));\r\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // express body-parser\r\napp.use(passport.initialize());\r\napp.use(passport.session());\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The order of these statements are important, so keep that in mind.\r\n\r\n### Using Sessions with Passport\r\n\r\nFor supporting sessions, passport has to be added as a middleware to the login route or endpoint that you are using to authenticate your users, usually with the redirect route values for your application:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Use the passport middleware for authentication\r\napp.post('/login', passport.authenticate('local', {\r\n    successRedirect: '/dashboard',\r\n    failureRedirect: '/login'\r\n}));\r\n```\r\nWhen a POST request with the user’s login information is made to the '/login' route, passport uses the local authentication strategy to verify that the user’s credentials are valid.\r\n\r\n### It then serializes the provided User model into one value that is stored in the session object provided by express-session.\r\n\r\n### When future requests from the same user are made with the session cookie, passport uses the serialized session value to deserialize or retrieve the User model.\r\n\r\nThis User object is made available through the request.user property.\r\n\r\nIn this way, passport builds upon the functionality provided by the express-session package.\r\n\r\nLogging Out\r\nPassport includes a logout() function on request that can be called from a route handler. It removes the request.user property and clears the login session.\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.get('/logout', (request, response) => {\r\n  request.logout();\r\n  response.redirect('/');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Good resources\r\n - https://mianlabs.com/2018/05/09/understanding-sessions-and-local-authentication-in-express-with-passport-and-mongodb/\r\n"

By default, Axios expects JSON and will parse this back into a JavaScript object for you.\r\nstatus: the HTTP code returned from the server.\r\nstatusText: the HTTP status message returned by the server.\r\nheaders: all the headers sent back by the server.\r\nconfig: the original request configuration.\r\nrequest: the actual XMLHttpRequest object (when running in a browser).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrouter.post('/login',\r\n    (req, res, next) => {\r\n        console.log('routes/user.js, login, req.body: ')\r\n        console.log(req.body)\r\n        next()\r\n    },\r\n    passport.authenticate('local'),\r\n    (req, res) => {\r\n        console.log('loggedin', req.user);\r\n        var userInfor = {\r\n            username: req.user.username\r\n        };\r\n        res.send(userInfo)\r\n    }\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Step-3\r\n\r\n[In the above file routes/user.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/SignUp-Form-with-Passport/blob/master/server/routes/user.js)\r\n\r\n I have ``passport.authenticate()`` - http://www.passportjs.org/docs/downloads/html/ -\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthenticating requests is as simple as calling passport.authenticate() and specifying which strategy to employ (  its first parameter, in this case 'local' ). authenticate()'s function signature is standard Connect middleware, which makes it convenient to use as route middleware in Express applications.\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.post('/login',\r\n  passport.authenticate('local'),\r\n  function(req, res) {\r\n    // If this function gets called, authentication was successful.\r\n    // `req.user` contains the authenticated user.\r\n    res.redirect('/users/' + req.user.username);\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, if authentication fails, Passport will respond with a 401 Unauthorized status, and any additional route handlers will not be invoked. If authentication succeeds, the next handler will be invoked and the req.user property will be set to the authenticated user.\r\n\r\n4> The \"login\" route is defined using the router.post() method, which responds only to HTTP POST requests. The first argument to this method is the URL path while the second is a callback function that will be invoked if an HTTP POST request with the path is received."

It does all \"reasonable\" things along the way with errors, end of files, if one side falls behind etc.\r\n\r\n### What are Streams\r\n\r\n\r\nStreams are collections of data — just like arrays or strings. The difference is that streams might not be available all at once, and they don’t have to fit in memory. This makes streams really powerful when working with large amounts of data, or data that’s coming from an external source one chunk at a time.\r\n\r\nHowever, streams are not only about working with big data. They also give us the power of composability in our code. Just like we can compose powerful linux commands by piping other smaller Linux commands, we can do exactly the same in Node with streams.\r\n\r\nStreams are unix pipes that let you easily read data from a source and pipe it to a destination. Simply put, a stream is nothing but an EventEmitter and implements some specials methods. Depending on the methods implemented, a stream becomes Readable, Writable, or Duplex (both readable and writable). Readable streams let you read data from a source while writable streams let you write data to a destination.\r\n\r\n#### An implementation, for a functionality of uploading image to mongodb, where I am using grid-stream packages to read and write directly to mongodb and then making it available to the write-stream\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/rohan-paul/mongo_file_uploads/blob/master/app.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/mongo_file_uploads/blob/master/app.js)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n// Init gridfs-stream\r\nlet gfs;\r\n\r\nif (file.contentType === 'image/jpeg' || file.contentType === 'image/png') {\r\n            const readStream = gfs.createReadStream(file.filename);\r\n            readStream.pipe(res)\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Piping is a great mechanism in which you can read data from the source and write to destination without managing the flow yourself. Take a look at the following snippet:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar fs = require('fs');\r\nvar readableStream = fs.createReadStream('file1.txt');\r\nvar writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('file2.txt');\r\n\r\nreadableStream.pipe(writableStream);\r\n```\r\nThe above snippet makes use of the pipe() function to write the content of file1 to file2. As pipe() manages the data flow for you, you should not worry about slow or fast data flow. This makes pipe() a neat tool to read and write data. You should also note that pipe() returns the destination stream. So, you can easily utilize this to chain multiple streams together. Let’s see how!\r\n\r\n#### Here’s the magic line about pipe() that you need to remember:\r\n\r\n``readableSrc.pipe(writableDest)``\r\n\r\nIn this simple line, we’re piping the output of a readable stream — the source of data, as the input of a writable stream — the destination. The source has to be a readable stream and the destination has to be a writable one. Of course, they can both be duplex/transform streams as well. In fact, if we’re piping into a duplex stream, we can chain pipe calls just like we do in Linux:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nreadableSrc\r\n  .pipe(transformStream1)\r\n  .pipe(transformStream2)\r\n  .pipe(finalWrtitableDest)\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe pipe method returns the destination stream, which enabled us to do the chaining above. For streams a (readable), b and c (duplex), and d (writable), we can:\r\n\r\n```js\r\na.pipe(b).pipe(c).pipe(d)\r\n# Which is equivalent to:\r\na.pipe(b)\r\nb.pipe(c)\r\nc.pipe(d)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Which, in Linux, is equivalent to:\r\n\r\n``$ a | b | c | d``\r\n\r\nThe pipe method is the easiest way to consume streams. It’s generally recommended to either use the pipe method or consume streams with events, but avoid mixing these two. Usually when you’re using the pipe method you don’t need to use events, but if you need to consume the streams in more custom ways, events would be the way to go.\r\n\r\n### Good Reference\r\n\r\n1> https://www.sitepoint.com/basics-node-js-streams/\r\n\r\n2> https://medium.freecodecamp.org/node-js-streams-everything-you-need-to-know-c9141306be93"

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.\r\n\r\nAnd this is what StackOverflow has to offer:\r\n\r\n### Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O framework that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. They aren’t. Rather, the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.\r\n\r\nThis means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis engine takes your JavaScript code and converts it into a faster machine code. Machine code is low level code which the computer can run without needing to first interpret it.\r\n Firefox uses Mozilla’s SpiderMonkey JS engine, and Microsoft products use its Chakra engine.\r\n\r\n ### The Node.js Execution model\r\nIn very simplistic terms, when you connect to a traditional server, such as Apache, it will spawn a new thread to handle the request. In a language such as PHP or Ruby, any subsequent I/O operations (for example, interacting with a database) block the execution of your code until the operation has completed. That is, the server has to wait for the database lookup to complete before it can move on to processing the result. If new requests come in while this is happening, the server will spawn new threads to deal with them. This is potentially inefficient, as a large number of threads can cause a system to become sluggish — and, in the worse case, for the site to go down. The most common way to support more connections is to add more servers.\r\n\r\nNode.js, however, is single-threaded. It is also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event. \r\n\r\n### For example, when a new request comes in (one kind of event) the server will start processing it. If it then encounters a blocking I/O operation, instead of waiting for this to complete, it will register a callback before continuing to process the next event. When the I/O operation has finished (another kind of event), the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original request. Under the hood, Node uses the libuv library to implement this asynchronous (i.e. non-blocking) behavior.\r\n\r\nNode’s execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections. The traditional approach to scaling a Node app is to clone it and have the cloned instances share the workload. Node.js even has a built-in module to help you implement a cloning strategy on a single server.\r\n\r\nSource: https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/"

        "content": "## The REST architectural style describes six constraints.\r\n\r\nThese constraints, applied to the architecture, were originally communicated by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation (see https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) and defines the basis of RESTful-style.\r\n\r\nThe six constraints are:\r\n\r\n## 1. Uniform Interface - resources being identified by a persistent identifier: URIs are the ubiquitous choice of identifier\r\n\r\nThe uniform interface constraint defines the interface between clients and servers. It simplifies and decouples the architecture, which enables each part to evolve independently. The four guiding principles of the uniform interface are:\r\n\r\n### Resource-Based\r\nIndividual resources are identified in requests using URIs as resource identifiers. The resources themselves are conceptually separate from the representations that are returned to the client. For example, the server does not send its database, but rather, some HTML, XML or JSON that represents some database records expressed, for instance, in Finnish and encoded in UTF-8, depending on the details of the request and the server implementation.\r\n\r\n### Manipulation of Resources Through Representations\r\nWhen a client holds a representation of a resource, including any metadata attached, it has enough information to modify or delete the resource on the server, provided it has permission to do so.\r\n\r\n### Self-descriptive Messages\r\nEach message includes enough information to describe how to process the message. For example, which parser to invoke may be specified by an Internet media type (previously known as a MIME type). Responses also explicitly indicate their cache-ability.\r\n\r\n### Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)\r\nClients deliver state via body contents, query-string parameters, request headers and the requested URI (the resource name). Services deliver state to clients via body content, response codes, and response headers. This is technically referred-to as hypermedia (or hyperlinks within hypertext).\r\n\r\nAside from the description above, HATEOS also means that, where necessary, links are contained in the returned body (or headers) to supply the URI for retrieval of the object itself or related objects. We'll talk about this in more detail later.\r\n\r\nThe uniform interface that any REST services must provide is fundamental to its design.\r\n\r\n## 2. Stateless - No client data is stored on the server between requests and session state is stored on the client.\r\n\r\nAs REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer, statelessness is key. Essentially, what this means is that the necessary state to handle the request is contained within the request itself, whether as part of the URI, query-string parameters, body, or headers. The URI uniquely identifies the resource and the body contains the state (or state change) of that resource. Then after the server does it's processing, the appropriate state, or the piece(s) of state that matter, are communicated back to the client via headers, status and response body.\r\n\r\nMost of us who have been in the industry for a while are accustomed to programming within a container which provides us with the concept of “session” which maintains state across multiple HTTP requests. In REST, the client must include all information for the server to fulfill the request, resending state as necessary if that state must span multiple requests. Statelessness enables greater scalability since the server does not have to maintain, update or communicate that session state. Additionally, load balancers don't have to worry about session affinity for stateless systems.\r\n\r\nSo what's the difference between state and a resource? State, or application state, is that which the server cares about to fulfill a request—data necessary for the current session or request. A resource, or resource state, is the data that defines the resource representation—the data stored in the database, for instance. Consider application state to be data that could vary by client, and per request. Resource state, on the other hand, is constant across every client who requests it.\r\n\r\nEver had back-button issues with a web application where it went AWOL at a certain point because it expected you to do things in a certain order? That's because it violated the statelessness principle. There are cases that don't honor the statelessness principle, such as three-legged OAuth, API call rate limiting, etc. However, make every effort to ensure that application state doesn't span multiple requests of your service(s).\r\n\r\n## 3. Cacheable - Clients can cache response (just like browsers caching static elements of a web page) to improve performance.\r\n\r\nAs on the World Wide Web, clients can cache responses. Responses must therefore, implicitly or explicitly, define themselves as cacheable, or not, to prevent clients reusing stale or inappropriate data in response to further requests. Well-managed caching partially or completely eliminates some client–server interactions, further improving scalability and performance.\r\n\r\n## 4. Client-Server - The client handles the front end the server handles the backend and can both be replaced independently of each other.\r\n\r\nThe uniform interface separates clients from servers. This separation of concerns means that, for example, clients are not concerned with data storage, which remains internal to each server, so that the portability of client code is improved. Servers are not concerned with the user interface or user state, so that servers can be simpler and more scalable. Servers and clients may also be replaced and developed independently, as long as the interface is not altered.\r\n\r\n## 5. Layered System\r\nA client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way. Intermediary servers may improve system scalability by enabling load-balancing and by providing shared caches. Layers may also enforce security policies.\r\n\r\n## 6. Code on Demand (optional)\r\nServers are able to temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring logic to it that it can execute. Examples of this may include compiled components such as Java applets and client-side scripts such as JavaScript.\r\n\r\nComplying with these constraints, and thus conforming to the REST architectural style, will enable any kind of distributed hypermedia system to have desirable emergent properties, such as performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability and reliability."

        "content": "### Cookie-Based Authentication\r\n\r\nCookie-based authentication has been the default, tried-and-true method for handling user authentication for a long time.\r\n\r\n#### Cookie-based authentication is **stateful**. This means that an authentication record or session must be kept both server and client-side. The server needs to keep track of active sessions in a database, while on the front-end a cookie is created that holds a session identifier, thus the name cookie based authentication. Let's look at the flow of traditional cookie-based authentication:\r\n\r\nUser enters their login credentials.\r\nServer verifies the credentials are correct and creates a session which is then stored in a database.\r\nA cookie with the session ID is placed in the users browser.\r\nOn subsequent requests, the session ID is verified against the database and if valid the request processed.\r\nOnce a user logs out of the app, the session is destroyed both client-side and server-side.\r\n\r\n###Token-Based Authentication\r\n\r\nToken-based authentication has gained prevalence over the last few years due to the rise of single page applications, web APIs, and the Internet of Things (IoT). When we talk about authentication with tokens, we generally talk about authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). While there are different ways to implement tokens, JWTs have become the de-facto standard. With this context in mind, the rest of the article will use tokens and JWTs interchangeably.\r\n\r\n#### Token-based authentication is **stateless**. The server does not keep a record of which users are logged in or which JWTs have been issued. Instead, every request to the server is accompanied by a token which the server uses to verify the authenticity of the request. The token is generally sent as an addition Authorization header in the form of Bearer {JWT}, but can additionally be sent in the body of a POST request or even as a query parameter. Let's see how this flow works:\r\n\r\n- User enters their login credentials.\r\n- Server verifies the credentials are correct and generates and returns a signed token.\r\n- This token is stored client-side, most commonly in local storage - but can be stored in session storage or a cookie as well.\r\n- Subsequent requests to the server include this token as an additional Authorization header or through one of the other methods mentioned above.\r\n- The server decodes the JWT and if the token is valid processes the request.\r\n- Once a user logs out, the token is destroyed client-side, no interaction with the server is necessary.\r\n\r\n### Advantages of Token-Based Authentication\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how something works is only half the battle. Next, we'll cover the reasons why token authentication is preferable over the traditional cookie-based approach.\r\n\r\n### Stateless, Scalable, and Decoupled\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest advantage to using tokens over cookies is the fact that token authentication is stateless. The back-end does not need to keep a record of tokens. Each token is self-contained, containing all the data required to check it's validity as well as convey user information through claims.\r\n\r\nThe server's only job, then, becomes to sign tokens on a successful login request and verify that incoming tokens are valid. In fact, the server does not even need to sign tokens. Third party services such as Auth0 can handle the issuing of tokens and then the server only needs to verify the validity of the token.\r\n\r\n### Cross Domain and CORS\r\n\r\nCookies work well with singular domains and sub-domains, but when it comes to managing cookies across different domains, it can get hairy. In contrast, a token-based approach with CORS enabled makes it trivial to expose APIs to different services and domains. Since the JWT is required and checked with each and every call to the back-end, as long as there is a valid token, requests can be processed. There are a few caveats to this and we'll address those in the Common Questions and Concerns section below.\r\n\r\n### Store Data in the JWT\r\n\r\nWith a cookie based approach, you simply store the session id in a cookie. JWT's, on the other hand, allow you to store any type of metadata, as long as it's valid JSON. The JWT spec specifies different types of claims that can be included such as reserved, public and private. You can learn more about the specifics and the differences between the types of claims on the jwt.io website.\r\n\r\nIn practice, what this means is that a JWT can contain any type of data. Depending on your use case you may choose to make the minimal amount of claims such as the user id and expiration of the token, or you may decide to include additional claims such as the user's email address, who issued the token, scopes or permissions for the user, and more.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nWhen using the cookie-based authentication, the back-end has to do a lookup, whether that be a traditional SQL database or a NoSQL alternative, and the round trip is likely to take longer compared to decoding a token. Additionally, since you can store additional data inside the JWT, such as the user's permission level, you can save yourself additional lookup calls to get and process the requested data.\r\n\r\nFor example, say you had an API resource /api/orders that retrieves the latest orders placed via your app, but only users with the role of admin have access to view this data. In a cookie based approach, once the request is made, you'd have one call to the database to verify that the session is valid, another to get the user data and verify that the user has the role of admin, and finally a third call to get the data. On the other hand, with a JWT approach, you can store the user role in the JWT, so once the request is made and the JWT verified, you can make a single call to the database to retrieve the orders.\r\n\r\n### JWT Size\r\n\r\nThe biggest disadvantage of token authentication is the size of JWTs. A session cookie is relatively tiny compared to even the smallest JWT. Depending on your use case, the size of the token could become problematic if you add many claims to it. Remember, each request to the server must include the JWT along with it.\r\n\r\n### Where to Store Tokens?\r\n\r\nWith token-based auth, you are given the choice of where to store the JWT. Commonly, the JWT is placed in the browser's local storage and this works well for most use cases. There are some issues with storing JWTs in local storage to be aware of. Unlike cookies, local storage is sandboxed to a specific domain and its data cannot be accessed by any other domain including sub-domains. **Because localStorage works on same-origin policy. So, data stored will only be available on the same origin.**\r\n\r\nYou can store the token in a cookie instead, but the max size of a cookie is only 4kb so that may be problematic if you have many claims attached to the token. Additionally, you can store the token in session storage which is similar to local storage but is cleared as soon as the user closes the browser.\r\n\r\n### XSS and XSRF Protection\r\n\r\nProtecting your users and servers is always a top priority. One of the most common concerns developers have when deciding on whether to use token-based authentication is the security implications. Two of the most common attack vectors facing websites are Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF or CSRF).\r\n\r\nCross Site Scripting) attacks occur when an outside entity is able to execute code within your website or app. The most common attack vector here is if your website allows inputs that are not properly sanitized. If an attacker can execute code on your domain, your JWT tokens are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nXSS attacks are much easier to deal with compared to XSRF attacks because they are generally better understood. Many frameworks, including Angular, automatically sanitize inputs and prevent arbitrary code execution. If you are not using a framework that sanitizes input/output out-of-the-box, you can look at plugins like caja developed by Google to assist. Sanitizing inputs is a solved issue in many frameworks and languages and I would recommend using a framework or plugin vs building your own.\r\n\r\n#### Cross Site Request Forgery attacks are not an issue if you are using JWT with local storage.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if your use case requires you to store the JWT in a cookie, you will need to protect against XSRF. XSRF are not as easily understood as XSS attacks. Luckily, preventing XSRF attacks is a fairly simple matter. To over-simplify, protecting against an XSRF attack, your server, upon establishing a session with a client will generate a unique token (note this is not a JWT). Then, anytime data is submitted to your server, a hidden input field will contain this token and the server will check to make sure the tokens match. Again, as our recommendation is to store the JWT in local storage, you probably will not have to worry about XSRF attacks.\r\n\r\n#### Luckily, preventing XSRF attacks is a fairly simple matter.

Again, as our recommendation is to store the JWT in local storage, you probably will not have to worry about XSRF attacks.\r\n\r\n### Ways to protect token\r\n\r\n1> One of the best ways to protect your users and servers is to have a short expiration time for tokens. That way, even if a token is compromised, it will quickly become useless.\r\n\r\n2> Additionally, you may maintain a blacklist of compromised tokens and not allow those tokens access to the system.\r\n\r\n3> Finally, the nuclear approach would be to change the signing algorithm, which would invalidate all active tokens and require all of your users to log in again. This approach is not easily recommended, but is available in the event of a severe breach.\r\n\r\n### Tokens Are Signed, Not Encrypted\r\n\r\nA JSON Web Token is comprised of three parts: the header, payload, and signature. The format of a JWT is header.payload.signature. If we were to sign a JWT with the HMACSHA256 algorithm, the secret 'shhhh' and the payload of:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\"sub\": \"1234567890\",\r\n\"name\": \"Ado Kukic\",\r\n\"admin\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe JWT generated would be:\r\n\r\neyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkFkbyBLdWtpYyIsImFkbWluIjp0cnVlLCJpYXQiOjE0NjQyOTc4ODV9.Y47kJvnHzU9qeJIN48_bVna6O0EDFiMiQ9LpNVDFymM\r\n\r\n#### The very important thing to note here is that this token is signed by the HMACSHA256 algorithm, and the header and payload are Base64URL encoded, it is not encrypted. If I go to jwt.io, paste this token and select the HMACSHA256 algorithm, I could decode the token and read its contents. Therefore, it should go without saying that sensitive data, such as passwords, should never be stored in the payload.\r\n\r\n#### If you must store sensitive data in the payload or your use case calls for the JWT to be obscured, you can use JSON Web Encryption (JWE). JWE allows you to encrypt the contents of a JWT so that it is not readable by anyone but the server. JOSE provides a great framework and different options for JWE and has SDKs for many popular frameworks including NodeJS and Java.\r\n\r\n### Further resources to refer\r\n\r\n1> [https://dzone.com/articles/cookies-vs-tokens-the-definitive-guide](https://dzone.com/articles/cookies-vs-tokens-the-definitive-guide)\r\n\r\n2>\r\n"

        "content": "**localStorage** and **sessionStorage** both extend Storage. There is no difference between them except for the intended \"non-persistence\" of sessionStorage.\r\n\r\n**That is, the data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site.**\r\n\r\nFor sessionStorage, changes are only available per tab. Changes made are saved and available for the current page in the that tab until it is closed. Once it is closed, the stored data is deleted.\r\n\r\n[From Official Dox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)\r\n\r\nThe two mechanisms within Web Storage are as follows:\r\n\r\n**sessionStorage** maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores)\r\n\r\n**localStorage** does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.\r\n\r\nThese mechanisms are available via the **Window.sessionStorage** and **Window.localStorage** properties (to be more precise, in supporting browsers the Window object implements the WindowLocalStorage and WindowSessionStorage objects, which the localStorage and sessionStorage properties hang off) — invoking one of these will create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed. A different Storage object is used for the sessionStorage and localStorage for each origin — they function and are controlled separately.\r\n\r\nlocalStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client scripts between pages (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of sensitive or security-related data within applications.\r\n\r\n#### sessionStorage (as the name suggests) is only available for the duration of the browser session (and is deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it does, however, survive page reloads (source DOM Storage guide - Mozilla Developer Network). Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is preferable to sessionStorage. The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site.\r\n\r\n### LocalStorage - Some more details\r\n\r\n##### Advantage of localStorage -\r\n1> Storage limit is the maximum amongst the three\r\n\r\n2> One of the most important differences is that unlike with cookies, data does not have to be sent back and forth with every HTTP request. This reduces the overall traffic between the client and the server and the amount of wasted bandwidth. This is because data is stored on the user’s local disk and is not destroyed or cleared by the loss of an internet connection.\r\n\r\n##### Disadvantage of localStorage -\r\n\r\n1> LocalStorage becomes slower as more data is stored4. For most browsers the time it takes for localStorage.getItem to return increases from a few milliseconds with a near empty storage to over a second with a full storage.\r\n\r\n2> It works on same-origin policy. So, data stored will only be available on the same origin.\r\n\r\n3> Any JavaScript code on your page can access local storage: it has no data protection whatsoever. This is the big one for security reasons \r\n\r\n### SessionStorage - Some more details\r\n1> \r\n\r\n##### Advantage of sessionStorage -\r\n\r\n##### Disadvantage of sessionStorage -\r\n\r\n1> The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set.\r\n\r\n2> Like localStorage, it works on same-origin policy. So, data stored will only be available on the same origin.\r\n\r\n### More General Info\r\n\r\nThe maximum storage available is different per browser, but most browsers have implemented at least the w3c recommended maximum storage limit of 5MB.\r\n\r\n+----------------+--------+---------+-----------+--------+\r\n| | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | IE |\r\n+----------------+--------+---------+-----------+--------+\r\n| LocalStorage | 10MB | 10MB | 5MB | 10MB |\r\n+----------------+--------+---------+-----------+--------+\r\n| SessionStorage | 10MB | 10MB | Unlimited | 10MB |\r\n+----------------+--------+---------+-----------+--------+\r\n**Always catch LocalStorage security and quota exceeded errors**\r\n\r\nQuotaExceededError: When storage limits exceeds on this function window.sessionStorage.setItem(key, value);, it throws a \"QuotaExceededError\" DOMException exception if the new value couldn't be set. (Setting could fail if, e.g., the user has disabled storage for the site, or if the quota has been exceeded.)\r\n\r\nDOMException.QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR is 22, example fiddle.\r\n\r\nSecurityError : Uncaught SecurityError: Access to 'localStorage' is denied for this document.\r\n\r\nCHROME:-Privacy and security « Content settings « Cookies « Block third-party cookies.\r\nStorageEvent « The storage event is fired on a document's Window object when a storage area changes. When a user agent is to send a storage notification for a Document, the user agent must queue a task to fire an event named storage at the Document object's Window object, using StorageEvent.\r\n\r\n### Cookie\r\n\r\nCompared to others, there's no advantages of Cookies\r\n\r\nStores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent requests. Its expiration varies based on the type and the expiration duration can be set from either server-side or client-side (normally from server-side).\r\n\r\nCookies are primarily for server-side reading (can also be read on client-side), localStorage and sessionStorage can only be read on client-side.\r\nCookies Size must be less than 4KB.\r\nCookies can be made secure by setting the httpOnly flag as true for that cookie. This prevents client-side access to that cookie\r\n"

        "content": "## What are Streams?\r\n\r\n\r\nStreams are collections of data — just like arrays or strings. The difference is that streams might not be available all at once, and they don’t have to fit in memory. This makes streams really powerful when working with large amounts of data, or data that’s coming from an external source one chunk at a time.\r\n\r\nHowever, streams are not only about working with big data. They also give us the power of composability in our code. Just like we can compose powerful linux commands by piping other smaller Linux commands, we can do exactly the same in Node with streams.\r\n\r\nAns. Typically, Stream is a mechanism for transferring data between two points. Node.js provides you streams\r\nto read data from the source or to write data to the destination. In Node.js, Streams can be readable, writable, or\r\nboth and all streams are instances of EventEmitter class.\r\n\r\nStreams are unix pipes that let you easily read data from a source and pipe it to a destination. Simply put, a stream is nothing but an EventEmitter and implements some specials methods. Depending on the methods implemented, a stream becomes Readable, Writable, or Duplex (both readable and writable). Readable streams let you read data from a source while writable streams let you write data to a destination.\r\n\r\nIf you have already worked with Node.js, you may have come across streams.\r\n#### For example, in a Node.js based HTTP server, request is a readable stream and response is a writable stream. You might have used fs module which lets you work with both readable and writable file streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar http = require('http');\r\nvar server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {\r\n    // here, req is a readable stream\r\n    // here, res is a writable stream\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## What are the different types of Streams?\r\n\r\nNode.js supports four types of streams as given below:\r\n\r\n### Readable - Used for read operation.\r\n\r\n### Writable - Used for write operation.\r\n\r\n### Duplex - Used for both read and write operations. Both operations are independent and each have separate internal buffer.\r\n\r\n### Transform - A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input. Both operations are linked via some transform.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Many of the built-in modules in Node implement the streaming interface:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"Streams-Node.jpeg\">\r\n\r\nThe list above has some examples for native Node.js objects that are also readable and writable streams. Some of these objects are both readable and writable streams, like TCP sockets, zlib and crypto streams.\r\n\r\nNotice that the objects are also closely related. While an HTTP response is a readable stream on the client, it’s a writable stream on the server. This is because in the HTTP case, we basically read from one object (http.IncomingMessage) and write to the other (http.ServerResponse).\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Using fs.createWriteStream()](https://stackabuse.com/writing-to-files-in-node-js/)\r\n\r\nWhen handling particularly large files, or files that come in chunks, say from a network connection, using streams is preferable to writing files in one go via the above methods that write entire files.\r\n\r\nStreams write small amounts of data at a time. While this has the disadvantage of being slower because data is transferred in chunks, it has advantages for RAM performance. Since the whole file is not loaded in memory all at once, RAM usage is lower.\r\n\r\nTo write to a file using streams, you need to create a new writable stream. You can then write data to the stream at intervals, all at once, or according to data availability from a server or other process, then close the stream for good once all the data packets have been written.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst fs = require('fs');\r\n\r\nconst writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('secret.txt');\r\n\r\n// write some data with a base64 encoding\r\nwriteStream.write('aef35ghhjdk74hja83ksnfjk888sfsf', 'base64');\r\n\r\n// the finish event is emitted when all data has been flushed from the stream\r\nwriteStream.on('finish', () => {\r\n    console.log('wrote all data to file')\r\n})\r\n\r\nwriteStream.end();\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe created a writable stream, then wrote some data to the stream. We have included a log statement when the \"finish\" event is emitted, letting us know that all data has been flushed to the underlying system. In this case, that means all data has been written to the file system.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Further Reading\r\n\r\n1> [https://www.sitepoint.com/basics-node-js-streams/](https://www.sitepoint.com/basics-node-js-streams/)\r\n\r\n2> [https://medium.freecodecamp.org/node-js-streams-everything-you-need-to-know-c9141306be93](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/node-js-streams-everything-you-need-to-know-c9141306be93)\r\n\r\n3>"

Here is an example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfs.readFile(\"file.json\", function (err, data) {\r\n  if (err) {\r\n    console.error(err)\r\n  }\r\n  console.log(data)\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny asynchronous method expects one of the arguments to be a callback. The full callback argument list depends on the caller method, but the first argument is always an error object or null. When we go for the asynchronous method, an exception thrown during function execution cannot be detected in a try/catch statement. The event happens after the JavaScript engine leaves the try block.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding example, if any exception is thrown during the reading of the file, it lands on the callback function as the first and mandatory parameter.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">\r\n    <b><a href=\"#\">↥ back to top</a></b>\r\n</div>\r\n"

        "content": "## 1. How is Node.js different different from Javascript?\r\n\r\n__Ans:__ Node.js uses a library called [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv), to bring an asynchronous event driven model to Javscript. It piggy backs on Chrome's Javascript Engine called V8 to enable the use of Javascript's call stack.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Node.js special is the different set of APIs. In browsers, you have a variety of DOM/Web APIs exposed that help you interact with UI and allow you to access the hardware to a limited extent. To compare, Node.js comes with many APIs suitable for backend development, e.g. the support for file systems, http requests, streams, child processes, etc. Browsers do offer some basic support for file systems or http requests, but those are usually limited due to security concerns.\r\n\r\nNode.js is a good choice for applications that have to\r\n\r\n - **process a high volume of short messages requiring low latency. Such systems are called real-time applications (RTAs)** - Thanks to its specifications, Node.js will be a good choice for the real-time collaborative drawing/editing-type apps, where you can watch the document being modified live by someone else (such as Trello, Dropbox Paper or Google Docs). One of the most popular uses of RTAs are **live-chat and instant-messaging apps**.\r\n\r\n - **Video conference app that will work with specific hardware or VoIP**.\r\n\r\n - **nline gaming apps or e-commerce transaction software, where online data is of much importance**\r\n\r\n- **Noe is quite a natural fit for exposing the data from object DBs (e.g. MongoDB)**. JSON stored data allow Node.js to function without the impedance mismatch and data conversion.\r\n\r\nNode.js is very efficient with real-time applications: it facilitates handling multiple client requests, enables sharing and reusing packages of library code, and the data sync between the client and server happens very fast.\r\n\r\n## When Node.js should not be used?\r\n\r\n- When have lot of synchronous code that needs to be run. Applications which require  number crunching or data analysis should not use Node.js. For Ex. Matrix Multiplication, Summation, Aggregation of large datasets. In such cases, applications which allow Multi Threading out of the box like Python, Java should be used.\r\n\r\n- **CPU-heavy jobs** - Node.js is based on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, and uses only a single CPU core. CPU-heavy operations will just block incoming requests, rendering the biggest advantage of Node.js useless.\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "First note, - **Await works only with Promises, it does not work with callbacks. So to implement async-await to a function/code, I first have to convert the callback to a Promise **\r\n\r\nFist let's take the simplest of example. `setTimeout` is a straightforward browser API that waits for a specified period of time and then executes a callback. A standard use looks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction doStuff() {\r\n  /_..._/;\r\n}\r\n\r\nsetTimeout(doStuff, 300);\r\n```\r\n\r\nA Promise-based API for this function would likely look something like this code.\r\n\r\n`timeout(300).then(doStuff)`\r\n\r\nWe can create an API like that using setTimeout. To do that, we’ll need a function timeout which takes a timeout variable and returns a Promise.\r\n\r\nYou can define A+ compliant Promises using the Promise constructor, which expects a single function as an argument. That function takes 2 arguments (both are callbacks), a resolve function and a reject function. The wonderful thing is that under the covers these are just callback functions that the Promise api glosses over.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction timeout(delay) {\r\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\r\n    setTimeout(resolve, delay);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe don’t use the reject callback, since setTimeout doesn’t provide any hooks for an error state. So we pass resolve as the callback to setTimeout, and that is all we need. Now we have a great chainable setTimeout function that we could include in a Promise chain.\r\n\r\n##### Now lets do a slightly more complicated version of the same exercise\r\n\r\n[Source Code](https://github.com/coreyc/converting-callbacks/blob/master/index.js)\r\n\r\n### Callback version\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst callbackFn = (firstName, callback) => {\r\n  setTimeout(() => {\r\n    if (!firstName) return callback(new Error(\"no first name passed in!\"));\r\n\r\n    const fullName = `${firstName} Doe`;\r\n\r\n    return callback(fullName);\r\n  }, 2000);\r\n};\r\n\r\ncallbackFn(\"John\", console.log);\r\ncallbackFn(null, console.log);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're using the setTimeout() function in order to make our function asynchronous. In addition to setTimeout(), other asynchronous operations you're likely to see in the real-world are: AJAX and HTTP calls, database calls, filesystem calls (in the case of Node, if no synchronous version exists), etc.\r\n\r\nIn this function, we \"reject\" it if the first name argument is null. When we do pass in the firstName argument, the callback function (almost always the last argument in a callback-based function's argument list) gets called and returns our value after the 2 seconds set in setTimeout().\r\n\r\n### Promise version - And here's the Promise-based version of that function:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst promiseFn = firstName => {\r\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      if (!firstName) reject(new Error(\"no first name passed in!\"));\r\n\r\n      const fullName = `${firstName} Doe`;\r\n\r\n      resolve(fullName);\r\n    }, 2000);\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n\r\npromiseFn(\"Jane\").then(console.log);\r\npromiseFn().catch(console.log);\r\n```\r\n\r\nConverting to a Promise-based function is actually pretty simple. Look at the below diagram for a visual explanation:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"convert-callback-to-promise-async-await-1.png\">\r\n\r\nFirst, we remove the callback argument. Then we add the code to return a new Promise from our Promise-based function. The error callback becomes a reject, while the \"happy path\" callback becomes a resolve. Promise returning functions should never throw, they should return rejections instead. Throwing from a promise returning function will force you to use both a } catch { and a .catch. People using promisified APIs do not expect promises to throw.\r\n\r\nRemember, Promise expects a single function as an argument. That function takes 2 arguments (both are callbacks), a resolve function and a reject function.\r\n\r\n**When we call the promiseFn, the result from the happy path will show up in the .then(), while the error scenario will show up in the .catch()**\r\n\r\nThe great thing about having our function in Promise form is that we don't actually need to \"make it an async/await version\" if we don't want to. When we call/execute the function, we can simply use the async/await keyword, like so:\r\n\r\n(Remember - **Await works only with Promises, it does not work with callbacks. So to implement async-await to a function/code, I first have to convert the callback to a Promise **)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst result = (async () => {\r\n  try {\r\n    console.log(await promiseFn(\"Jim\"));\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    console.log(e);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  try {\r\n    console.log(await promiseFn());\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    console.log(e);\r\n  }\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSide note: here I wrapped the function call in an IIFE (IIFE = \"Immediately Invoked Function Execution\") This is simply because we need to wrap the await call in a function that uses the async keyword. Here, there are no callbacks, no .then()'s or .catch()'s, we just use a try/catch block and call the promiseFn(). Promise rejections will be caught by the catch block.\r\n\r\n### async/await version\r\n\r\nBut what if we wanted to convert a callback function directly to an async/await version of that function? Without using Promises directly?\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst timeout = ms => {\r\n  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst asyncAwaitFn = async firstName => {\r\n  await timeout(2000); // using timeout like this makes it easier to demonstrate callback -> async/await conversion\r\n\r\n  if (!firstName) throw new Error(\"no first name passed in!\");\r\n\r\n  const fullName = `${firstName} Doe`;\r\n\r\n  return fullName;\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst res = (async () => {\r\n  try {\r\n    console.log(await asyncAwaitFn(\"Jack\"));\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    console.log(e);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  try {\r\n    console.log(await asyncAwaitFn());\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    console.log(e);\r\n  }\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the below diagram to understand how to go from callback to async\r\n\r\n<img src=\"convert-callback-to-async-await-directly.png\">\r\n\r\nSimilar to converting to the Promise-based version, we get rid of the callback passed in to the original function, as well as that argument call within the body of the function. Next, we add the async keyword to the beginning of the function declaration. And finally, when we hit the error scenario, we throw an Error, which results in a rejected Promise (caught in the catch block when we call the function), and simply return the fullName in the happy path scenario.\r\n\r\nNote that async functions all return Promises, so when you use return you are just resolving the Promise.\r\n\r\n#### Further reading\r\n\r\n1> https://benmccormick.org/2015/12/30/es6-patterns-converting-callbacks-to-promises\r\n\r\n2> https://dev.to/ccleary00/how-to-rewrite-a-callback-function-in-promise-form-and-asyncawait-form-in-javascript-410e - This one is greate, 3 ways to convert a callback step-by-step to Promise and async-await.\r\n\r\n3> https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/callbacks-promises-and-async-await-ad4756e01d90\r\n\r\n4> https://tylermcginnis.com/async-javascript-from-callbacks-to-promises-to-async-await/\r\n"

Each function gets executed in order, but each one is independent with it’s own setTimeout. They won’t wait for the last function to finish before they start.\r\n\r\nThis is super annoying, so let’s fix it with a callback.\r\n\r\n#### Function with callback implementation\r\n\r\nA callback is a function that is passed to another function. When the first function is done, it will run the second function.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction printString(string, callback) {\r\n  setTimeout(() => {\r\n    console.log(string);\r\n    callback();\r\n  }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, let’s try to print the letters A, B, C in that order:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction printAll() {\r\n  printString(\"A\", () => {\r\n    printString(\"B\", () => {\r\n      printString(\"C\", () => {});\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n}\r\nprintAll();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWell, the code is a lot uglier now, and I have created a callback-hell, but at least it works! Each time you call printAll, you get the same result. Promises to the rescue.\r\n\r\n### Promise implementation\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction printString(string) {\r\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      console.log(string);\r\n      resolve();\r\n    }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, just following the standard conversion technique from callback to Promise, wrap the whole function in a Promise, and instead of calling the callback, you call resolve (or reject if there is an error). The function returns this Promise object.\r\n\r\nAgain, let’s try to print the letters A, B, C in that order:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction printAll() {\r\n  printString(\"A\")\r\n    .then(() => {\r\n      return printString(\"B\");\r\n    })\r\n    .then(() => {\r\n      return printString(\"C\");\r\n    });\r\n}\r\nprintAll();\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy using features of arrow functions, we can remove the “wrapper” function. The code becomes cleaner, but still has a lot of unnecessary parenthesis:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction printAll() {\r\n  printString(\"A\")\r\n    .then(() => printString(\"B\"))\r\n    .then(() => printString(\"C\"));\r\n}\r\nprintAll();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Async-Await implementation\r\n\r\nAwait is basically syntactic sugar for Promises. It makes your asynchronous code look more like synchronous/procedural code, which is easier for humans to understand.\r\n\r\nThe printString function need to remain the same, as above in the promise version. Because **Await works only with Promises, it does not work with callbacks. So to implement async-await to a function/code, I first have to convert the callback to a Promise **\r\n\r\nAgain, let’s try to print the letters A, B, C in that order:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync function printAll() {\r\n  await printString(\"A\");\r\n  await printString(\"B\");\r\n  await printString(\"C\");\r\n}\r\nprintAll();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Now pass output of one function to the next function\r\n\r\nThe printString function doesn’t return anything and is independent, all we cared about was the order. But what if you wanted to take the output of the first function, do something with it in the second function, and then pass it to the third function?\r\n\r\nInstead of printing the string each time, let’s make a function that will concatenate the string and pass it on.\r\n\r\n### Callbacks Implementation\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction addString(previous, current, callback) {\r\n  setTimeout(() => {\r\n    callback(previous + \" \" + current);\r\n  }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// And in order to call it:\r\n\r\nfunction addAll() {\r\n  addString(\"\", \"A\", result => {\r\n    addString(result, \"B\", result => {\r\n      addString(result, \"C\", result => {\r\n        console.log(result); // Prints out \" A B C\"\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n}\r\naddAll();\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot so nice.\r\n\r\n### Promise Implementation\r\n\r\nHere it is in Promise style. Again same standard conversion technique from callback to Promise, wrap the whole function in a Promise, and instead of calling the callback, you call resolve (or reject if there is an error). The function returns this Promise object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction addString(previous, current) {\r\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      resolve(previous + \" \" + current);\r\n    }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\n// And in order to call it:\r\n\r\nfunction addAll() {\r\n  addString(\"\", \"A\")\r\n    .then(result => {\r\n      return addString(result, \"B\");\r\n    })\r\n    .then(result => {\r\n      return addString(result, \"C\");\r\n    })\r\n    .then(result => {\r\n      console.log(result); // Prints out \" A B C\"\r\n    });\r\n}\r\naddAll();\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing arrow functions means we can make the code a little nicer:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction addAll() {\r\n  addString(\"\", \"A\")\r\n    .then(result => addString(result, \"B\"))\r\n    .then(result => addString(result, \"C\"))\r\n    .then(result => {\r\n      console.log(result); // Prints out \" A B C\"\r\n    });\r\n}\r\naddAll();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is definitely more readable, especially if you add more to the chain, but still a mess of parenthesis.\r\n\r\n### Async-Await Implementation\r\n\r\nThe function stays the same as the Promise version. Because **Await works only with Promises, it does not work with callbacks. So to implement async-await to a function/code, I first have to convert the callback to a Promise **\r\n\r\nAnd in order to call it:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync function addAll() {\r\n  let toPrint = \"\";\r\n  toPrint = await addString(toPrint, \"A\");\r\n  toPrint = await addString(toPrint, \"B\");\r\n  toPrint = await addString(toPrint, \"C\");\r\n  console.log(toPrint); // Prints out \" A B C\"\r\n}\r\naddAll();\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/front-end-weekly/callbacks-promises-and-async-await-ad4756e01d90 - Very good explanation\r\n"

            "content": "#### Async/await is a language structure that complements promises. It allows us to work with promises with less boilerplate.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following definitions are equivalent:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction f() {\r\n    return Promise.resolve('TEST');\r\n}\r\n\r\n// asyncF is equivalent to f!\r\nasync function asyncF() {\r\n    return 'TEST';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Any async function returns a promise implicitly, and the resolve value of the promise will be whatever you return from the function**\r\n\r\n## Async - declares an asynchronous function (async function someName(){...}).\r\n\r\n- Automatically transforms a regular function into a Promise.\r\n- When called async functions resolve with whatever is returned in their body.\r\n- Async functions enable the use of await.\r\n\r\n## Await - pauses the execution of async functions. (var result = await someAsyncCall(); ).\r\n\r\n- When placed in front of a Promise call, await forces the rest of the code to wait until that Promise finishes and returns a result.\r\n- This will pause the async function and wait for the Promise to resolve prior to moving on.\r\n- **Await works only with Promises, it does not work with callbacks.**\r\n- Await can only be used inside async functions.\r\n\r\n## Thumb Rules\r\n\r\n- await blocks the code execution within the async function, of which it (i.e. the 'await' statement) is a part.\r\n\r\n- There can be multiple await statements within a single async function.\r\n\r\n- When using async await make sure to use try catch for error handling.\r\n\r\n- If my code contains blocking code it is better to make it an async function. By doing this I am making sure that somebody else can use your function asynchronously.\r\n\r\n- By making async functions out of blocking code, you are enabling the user who will call your function to decide on the level of asynhronicity he wants.\r\n\r\n- await only blocks the code execution within the async function. It only makes sure that next line is executed when the promise resolves. So if an asynchronous activity has already started then await will not have an effect on it.\r\n\r\n## Significance of Await\r\n\r\nWhen we spawn a promise we can’t synchronously wait for it to finish. We can only pass a callback via then. Waiting for a promise is disallowed to encourage the development of non-blocking code. Otherwise, developers would be tempted to perform blocking operations because it’s easier than working with promises and callbacks.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to synchronise promises we need to allow them to wait for each other. In other words, if an operation is asynchronous (i.e. encapsulated in a promise) it should be able to wait for another asynchronous operation to finish. But how would the JavaScript interpreter know if an operation is running within a promise or not?\r\n\r\nThe answer is in the async keyword. Every async function returns a promise. Thus, the JavaScript interpreter knows that all operations in async functions will be encapsulated in promises and run asynchronously. Therefore, it can allow them to wait for other promises to finish.\r\n\r\nEnter the await keyword. It can only be used in async functions, and allows us to synchronously wait on a promise. If we use promises outside of async functions we will still need to use then callbacks:\r\n\r\n```\r\nasync function f(){\r\n    // response will evaluate as the resolved value of the promise\r\n    const response = await rp('http://example.com/');\r\n    console.log(response);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Error Handling\r\n\r\nIn most previous examples, we assumed that the promises resolve successfully. Hence, await-ing on a promise returned a value. If a promise we await for fails, this will result in an exception within the async function. We can use standard try/catch to handle it, we just need to wrap our await calls like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nasync function doSomethingAsync(){\r\n    try {\r\n        // This async call may fail.\r\n        let result = await someAsyncCall();\r\n    }\r\n    catch(error) {\r\n        // If it does we will catch the error here.\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Async function without a try/catch block.**\r\n\r\n```\r\nasync function doSomethingAsync(){\r\n    // This async call may fail.\r\n    let result = await someAsyncCall();\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// We catch the error upon calling the function.\r\ndoSomethingAsync().\r\n    .then(successHandler)\r\n    .catch(errorHandler);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's important to choose which method of error handling you prefer and stick to it. Using both try/catch and .catch() at the same time will most probably lead to problems.\r\n\r\n**By wrapping the logic inside an async function, we can replace the then callbacks with await statements. The effect, the code pauses execution on those lines until the Promises resolve! Asynchronous programming becomes synchronous!**\r\n\r\nAsync/Await enables us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous fashion, which produces cleaner and easier-to-understand logic. Under the hood, it’s just syntactic sugar using [generators and yield statements to “pause” execution](https://tc39.github.io/ecmascript-asyncawait/#async-function-definitions). In other words, async functions can “pull out” the value of a Promise even though it’s nested inside a callback function, giving us the ability to assign it to a variable!\r\n\r\n##### Further Reading\r\n\r\n1> [Official ES6 Drafts](https://tc39.github.io/ecmascript-asyncawait/#async-function-definitions)\r\n\r\n2> [https://medium.com/siliconwat/how-javascript-async-await-works-3cab4b7d21da](https://medium.com/siliconwat/how-javascript-async-await-works-3cab4b7d21da)\r\n"

Let’s take an example:\r\n\r\nHere I defined a method named addOneTo that takes a number and returns number+1 through a callback. Meaning, that (number + 1) is passed as an argument to the callback and whatever the callback does inside it, is returned from the function as the final output.\r\nThis is a simplified example, usually, I/O or time-consuming tasks are done using callbacks.

            "content": "### Understanding how Promise makes code Asynchronous / non-blocking by understanding how Fetch API works\r\n\r\n#### Key Point - With the .then() method, we can chain our ASYNCHRONOUS calls in a SYNCHRONOUS manner. So, within the Promise block, I am converting few Asynchronous operations to Synchronous ones.\r\n\r\n## And during that time when those Synchronous operations are getting executed, whatever is after the chain of methods inside the Promise-related block, gets executed normally without being blocked or having to wait for them, while I wait for some execution ( e.g. waiting for response from an API) to happen within the Promise’s block of codes.\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/@wisecobbler/using-the-javascript-fetch-api-f92c756340f0\r\n\r\nPromises allow you to write asynchronous code, so for example, when you are making a request to the server, you aren’t blocking other code from running while you are waiting for the response back from the server. This is important for the Fetch API since it’s main purpose is to make requests for assets or data. You don’t want to stop your entire application from running when making these requests.\r\n\r\nPromise objects have a .then() method which takes two parameters — a success callback function and failure callback function. In this example, when the fetch method successfully returns from making the API request, the success callback function is called which has a Response object as it’s parameter. The Response object also has several methods available to it, one of which is a .json() method which also returns Promise. So, if you want to do anything with a response from an API request and that response is in a JSON format, you’ll need to do this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfetch(\"http://api.exampledomain.com/api/search\")\r\n  .then(function(response) {\r\n    return response.json();\r\n  })\r\n  .then(function(jsonData) {\r\n    //handle json data processing here\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you’ve got multiple API requests you want to make and you want to handle the data in a specific order, or you don’t want to display anything on the screen until all the data is returned from the various API requests, you’ll be chaining quite a few .then() functions together.\r\n\r\nOf course in the above situation I will use Promise.all() - But I get the point from above, that how .then works - i.e. it makes 2 / 3 asynchronous execution to follow a particular order.\r\n\r\n## Use case of Promise.all()\r\n\r\nThere are few use cases where Async/Await doesn't cut it and we have to go back to Promises for help. One such scenario is when we need to make multiple independent asynchronous calls and wait for all of them to finish.\r\n\r\nIf we try and do this with async and await, the following will happen: \\*/\r\n\r\n```js\r\ngetABC = async () => {\r\n  let A = await getValueA(); // getValueA takes 2 second to finish\r\n  let B = await getValueB(); // getValueB takes 4 second to finish\r\n  let C = await getValueC(); // getValueC takes 3 second to finish\r\n\r\n  return A * B * C;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we know, the await expression causes async function execution to pause until a Promise is resolved, that is fulfilled or rejected, and to resume execution of the async function after fulfillment. When resumed, the value of the await expression is that of the fulfilled Promise.\r\n\r\nEach await call will wait for the previous one to return a result. Since we are doing one call at a time the entire function will take 9 seconds from start to finish (2+4+3).\r\n\r\nThis is not an optimal solution, since the three variables A, B, and C aren't dependent on each other. In other words we don't need to know the value of A before we get B. We can get them at the same time and shave off a few seconds of waiting.\r\n\r\nTo send all requests at the same time a Promise.all() is required. This will make sure we still have all the results before continuing, but the asynchronous calls will be firing in parallel, not one after another.\r\n\r\n```js\r\ngetABC = async () => {\r\n  // Promise.all() allows us to send all requests at the same time. But of course, it will give me 3 independent results, from the 3 independent function invocations. From those 3 independent results, getting the final return value by applying reduce on them.\r\n\r\n  let results = Promise.all([getValueA, getValueB, getValueC]);\r\n\r\n  return results.reduce((total, value) => total * value);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe getValueA and getValueC calls will have already finished by the time getValueB ends. Instead of a sum of the times, we will effectively reduce the execution to the time of the slowest request (getValueB - 4 seconds).\r\n"

            "content": "#### A promise is an object that wraps an asynchronous operation and notifies when it’s done. This sounds exactly like callbacks, but the important differences are in the usage of Promises. Instead of providing a callback, a promise has its own methods (.then) which you call to tell the promise what will happen when it is successful or when it fails. The methods a promise provides are “then(…)” for when a successful result is available and “catch(…)” for when something went wrong.\r\n\r\nMore simply - The Promise constructor function takes in a single argument, a (callback) function. This function is going to be passed two arguments, resolve and reject.\r\n\r\n**resolve** - a function that allows you to change the status of the promise to fulfilled\r\n\r\n**reject** - a function that allows you to change the status of the promise to rejected.\r\n\r\n### How do you listen for when the status of a promise changes?\r\n\r\nThis is the most important question. It’s cool we know how to create a promise and change its status, but that’s worthless if we don’t know how to do anything after the status changes.\r\n\r\nWhat a promise actually is. When you create a new Promise, you’re really just creating a plain old JavaScript object. This object can invoke two methods, then, and catch. Here’s the key. When the status of the promise changes to fulfilled, the function that was passed to .then will get invoked. When the status of a promise changes to rejected, the function that was passed to .catch will be invoked. What this means is that once you create a promise, you’ll pass the function you want to run if the async request is successful to .then. You’ll pass the function you want to run if the async request fails to .catch.\r\n\r\nIn other words, **When we call a Promise function, the result from the successful path will show up in the .then(), while the error scenario will show up in the .catch()**\r\n\r\n#### It takes 2 arguments and both are callback functions. The first one is for the fullfilment case and the second one is for the rejection case.\r\n\r\n#### Promise in JS means, just as the word meaning, i.e. its not the value itself, but its the promise of a value.\r\n\r\n### Why Use Promises\r\n\r\nPromises provide a simpler alternative for executing, composing, and managing asynchronous operations when compared to traditional callback-based approaches. They also allow you to handle asynchronous errors using approaches that are similar to synchronous try/catch.\r\nPromise is basically just an object with 2 functions. A) A function named then() whcih is called anytime the promise is successful, and B) catch() function, which is called anytime something bad has happened.\r\n\r\n### All promise instances get a then method which allows you to react to the promise. The first then method callback receives the result given to it by the resolve() call: The then method on the promise object adds handlers for the resolved and rejected states. This function returns another promise object to allow for promise-pipelining, enabling the developer to chain together async operations where the result of the first operation will get passed to the second.\r\n\r\nPromises have a then method, which you can use to get the eventual return value (fulfillment) or thrown exception (rejection).\r\n\r\n```js\r\npromiseMeSomething().then(function(value) {}, function(reason) {});\r\n```\r\n\r\n`then(resolvedHandler, rejectedHandler);`\r\n\r\nIf promiseMeSomething returns a promise (remember that 'then' method returns a promise) that gets fulfilled later with a return value, the first function (the fulfillment handler) will be called with the value. However, if the promiseMeSomething function gets rejected later by a thrown exception, the second function (the rejection handler) will be called with the exception.\r\n\r\nNote that resolution of a promise is always asynchronous: that is, the fulfillment or rejection handler will always be called in the next turn of the event loop (i.e. process.nextTick in Node). This gives you a nice guarantee when mentally tracing the flow of your code, namely that then will always return before either handler is executed.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\r\n  // A mock async action using setTimeout\r\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(10), 1000);\r\n}).then(result => {\r\n  console.log(result);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Outputs 10 after 1000 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The then callback is triggered when the promise is resolved. You can also chain then method callbacks:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\r\n\t// A mock async action using setTimeout\r\n\tsetTimeout(() => resolve(10), 1000);\r\n})\r\n.then(num => {\r\n    console.log(`first then: ${num} `);\r\n    return num * 2;\r\n})\r\n.then(num => {\r\n    console.log(`Second then: ${num} `)\r\n    return num * 2\r\n})\r\n.then(num => {\r\n    console.log(`Third then: ${num} `)\r\n    return num * 2\r\n})\r\n\r\n// output\r\nfirst then: 10\r\nSecond then: 20\r\nThird then: 40\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Each then receives the result of the previous then's return value. If a promise has already resolved but then is called again, the callback immediately fires. If the promise is rejected and you call then after rejection, the callback is never called.\r\n\r\nIf you return a value, the next \"then\" is called with that value. However, if you return something promise-like, the next \"then\" waits on it, and is only called when that promise settles (succeeds/fails)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfetchData()\r\n  .then(prepareDataForCsv)\r\n  .then(writeToCsv)\r\n  .then(function() {\r\n    console.log(\"your csv has been saved\");\r\n  })\r\n  .catch(function(error) {\r\n    console.log(\"something went wrong\", error);\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Because of how the chaining of promises and errors work, as discussed earlier, it means that just one catch at the end of the chain is guaranteed to catch any errors thrown along the way. This makes error handling really straight forward.\r\n\r\n# Some of the key points of Promise’s Engineering\r\n\r\nA> http://farzicoder.com/Callback-Hell-Promises-generators-Async-Await-in-Node-js-Javascript/\r\n\r\n## A promise is an object that is returned immediately but the result arrives later in future. Promise takes a method with two arguments, resolve and reject. resolve is called when we have a result and reject is called when we have an error. This promise object returned has two methods, then and catch. then gets the result which was raised through the resolve method. catch gets the error thrown with the reject method. Using promises we can chain our asynchronous call in a synchronous manner.\r\n\r\n## B> BEST EXPLANATION - A promise is an object which can be returned synchronously from an asynchronous function. : - By Eric Elliot\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-promise-27fc71e77261\r\n\r\nBecause `.then()` always returns a new promise, it’s possible to chain promises with precise control over how and where errors are handled. Promises allow you to mimic normal synchronous code’s try/catch behavior.\r\n\r\nLike synchronous code, chaining will result in a sequence that runs in serial. In other words, you can do:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfetch(url)\r\n  .then(process)\r\n  .then(save)\r\n  .catch(handleErrors);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming each of the functions, fetch(), process(), and save() return promises, process() will wait for fetch() to complete before starting, and save() will wait for process() to complete before starting. handleErrors() will only run if any of the previous promises reject.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n1> [ECMAScript 2019 Language Specification Draft ECMA-262 / June 27, 2018](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-promise-constructor)\r\n"

This allows asynchronous operations to be chained together, so that they are guaranteed to happen in the correct order.\r\n\r\nB> https://medium.com/codebuddies/getting-to-know-asynchronous-javascript-callbacks-promises-and-async-await-17e0673281ee\r\n\r\nThe true power of promises is shown when you have several asynchronous operations that depend on each other. So let’s take the case where we have to make a request that depends on the result of another request.\r\n\r\n## Callback Hell Example\r\n\r\nFirst a quick note on request package - \"I shall be using the package 'request', and unlike the other popular network fetching packages like axios or the native Fetch API, 'request' does not return a Promise natively, and thats why I am using it here, so I can actually show how to return a Promise after a call with request. Per request's documentation - request supports both streaming and callback interfaces natively. If you'd like request to return a Promise instead, you can use an alternative interface wrapper for request.\"\r\n\r\nThe “request” function below, takes a function as its last argument. This function is not executed together with the code above. It is saved to be executed later once the underlying I/O operation of fetching data over HTTP(s) is done. The underlying HTTP(s) request is an asynchronous operation and does not block the execution of the rest of the JavaScript code. The callback function is put on a sort of queue called the “event loop” until it will be executed with a result from the request.\r\n\r\nCallbacks are a good way to declare what will happen once an I/O operation has a result, but what if you want to use that data in order to make another request? You can only handle the result of the request (if we use the example above) within the callback function provided.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar request = require(\"request\");\r\n\r\nlet result;\r\n\r\nrequest(\"http://www.google.com\", (error, response, body) => {\r\n  if (error) {\r\n    // Handle error\r\n  } else {\r\n    result = body;\r\n    console.log(\"Request successful\");\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nconsole.log(result);\r\n\r\n/* OUTPUT\r\n\r\nundefined\r\nRequest successful\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example above, the variable “result” will not have a value when printed to the console at the last line. And will output “undefined” to the console because at the time that line is being executed, the callback has not been called. Even if the request were somehow to complete before the result variable is printed to the console (which is almost impossible, as inside the callback I am making a network request to google.com server), this code will still run to completion before the callback is executed anyway because that is the nature of the non-blocking I/O model in JavaScript.\r\n\r\n## Because, by the non-blocking architecture, of JS / Node, while the callback is being executed ( making a request to google.com in this case) - the rest of the code after the callback function's block will continue to get executed.\r\n\r\n`( See my explanation in - Asynchronous-Non-blocking-Mechanism-in-Node.md)`\r\n\r\nSo if we want to do a second request based on the result of a first one we have to do it inside the callback function of the first request because that is where the result will be available:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar request = require(\"request\");\r\n\r\nlet result;\r\n\r\nrequest(\"http://www.google.com\", function(\r\n  firstError,\r\n  firstResponse,\r\n  firstBody\r\n) {\r\n  if (firstError) {\r\n    // Handle error.\r\n  } else {\r\n    request(`https://www.facebook.com`, function(\r\n      secondError,\r\n      secondResponse,\r\n      secondBody\r\n    ) {\r\n      if (secondError) {\r\n        // Handle error.\r\n      } else {\r\n        result = secondBody;\r\n        console.log(\"successfully hit facebook server\");\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nconsole.log(result);\r\n\r\n/* OUTPUT\r\n\r\nundefined\r\nsuccessfully hit facebook server\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne thing to note here is the first argument in every callback function will contain an error if something went wrong, or will be empty if all went well. This pattern is called “error first callbacks” and is very common. It is the standard pattern for callback-based APIs in NodeJs. This means that for every callback declared we need to check if there is an error and that just adds to the mess when dealing with nested callbacks.\r\n\r\nThis is the anti-pattern that has been named “callback hell”.\r\n\r\n### A promise is an object that wraps an asynchronous operation and notifies when it’s done. This sounds exactly like callbacks, but the important differences are in the usage of Promises. Instead of providing a callback, a promise has its own methods (.then) which you call to tell the promise what will happen when it is successful or when it fails. The methods a promise provides are “then(…)” for when a successful result is available and “catch(…)” for when something went wrong.\r\n\r\nBelow is general syntax\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsomeAsyncOperation(someParams)\r\n  .then(function(result) {\r\n    // Do something with the result\r\n  })\r\n  .catch(function(error) {\r\n    // Handle error\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, handle the above case with Promise I am using “axios” that is similar to “request” package but it uses promises instead of callbacks.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst axios = require(‘axios’);\r\n\r\naxios.get(‘http://www.somepage.com')\r\n.then(function (response) {\r\n    // response being the result of the first request\r\n    // Returns another promise to the next .then(..) in the chain\r\n    return axios.get(`http://www.somepage.com/${response.someValue}`);\r\n})\r\n.then(function response {\r\n    // response being the result of the second request\r\n    // Handle response\r\n})\r\n.catch(function (error) {\r\n    // Handle error.\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of nesting callbacks inside callbacks inside callbacks, you chain .then() calls together making it more readable and easier to follow. Every .then() should either return a new Promise or just a value or object which will be passed to the next .then() in the chain. Another important thing to notice is that even though we are doing two different asynchronous requests we only have one .catch() where we handle our errors. That’s because any error that occurs in the Promise chain will stop further execution and an error will end up in the next .catch() in the chain.\r\n\r\nA friendly reminder: just like with callback based APIs, this is still asynchronous operations. The code that is executed when the request has finished — that is, the subsequent .then() calls — is put on the event loop just like a callback function would be. This means you cannot access any variables passed to or declared in the Promise chain outside the Promise. The same goes for errors thrown in the Promise chain.\r\n\r\n### As a side note, remember the general syntax of chaining together axios calls\r\n\r\n```JS\r\naxios.get('http://google.com')\r\n    .then((response) => {\r\n        // do something with Google res\r\n        return axios.get('http://apple.com')\r\n        // response being the result of the first request\r\n        // do something with Apple res\r\n    })\r\n    .catch((err) => {\r\n        // handle err\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n"

Every .then() should either return a new Promise or just a value or object which will be passed to the next .then() in the chain. Another important thing to notice is that even though we are doing two different asynchronous requests we only have one .catch() where we handle our errors. That’s because any error that occurs in the Promise chain will stop further execution and an error will end up in the next .catch() in the chain.\r\n\r\nA friendly reminder: just like with callback based APIs, this is still asynchronous operations. The code that is executed when the request has finished — that is, the subsequent .then() calls — is put on the event loop just like a callback function would be. This means you cannot access any variables passed to or declared in the Promise chain outside the Promise. The same goes for errors thrown in the Promise chain.\r\n\r\n*/\r\n"

            "content": "And note some fundamentals of Promise - When you create a new Promise, you're really just creating a plain old JavaScript object. This object can invoke two methods, then, and catch. Both .then() and .catch() will return a new promise. That means that promises can be chained.\r\n\r\nA promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that it’s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.\r\n\r\n**Below, the most generic way I declare a Promise**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet genericPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n  // First a condition\r\n  if (1 === 1) {\r\n    resolve()\r\n  } else {\r\n    reject()\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe syntax for Javascript Promise.resolve() is the following.\r\n\r\n`Promise.resolve(value);`\r\n\r\nThis Promise resolves with the value parameter.\r\n\r\n#### VERY IMPORTANT - What is the difference between the below code of returning a Promise\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Promise(function(res, rej) {\r\n  res(\"aaa\")\r\n})\r\n  .then(function(result) {\r\n    return \"bbb\"\r\n  })\r\n  .then(function(result) {\r\n    console.log(result)\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### and the below way\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Promise(function(res, rej) {\r\n  res(\"aaa\")\r\n})\r\n  .then(function(result) {\r\n    return Promise.resolve(\"bbb\")\r\n  })\r\n  .then(function(result) {\r\n    console.log(result)\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Ans is -\r\n\r\nA value returned inside a then() handler becomes the resolution value of the promise returned from that then().\r\n\r\nThe only difference is that you're creating an unnecessary promise (by doing <return Promise.resolve(\"bbb\")>) when you do return Promise.resolve(\"bbb\").\r\n\r\n**So the following are all identical for a promise or plain value x:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nPromise.resolve(x)\r\n\r\nnew Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\r\n  resolve(x)\r\n})\r\nPromise.resolve().then(function() {\r\n  return x\r\n})\r\nPromise.all([x]).then(function(arr) {\r\n  return arr[0]\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n**In simple terms, inside a .then() handler function:**\r\n\r\nA) When x is a value (number, string, etc):\r\n\r\nreturn x is equivalent to return Promise.resolve(x)\r\nthrow x is equivalent to return Promise.reject(x)\r\n\r\nB) When x is a Promise that is already settled (not pending anymore):\r\n\r\nreturn x is equivalent to return Promise.resolve(x), if the Promise was already resolved.\r\nreturn x is equivalent to return Promise.reject(x), if the Promise was already rejected.\r\n\r\nC) When x is a Promise that is pending:\r\n\r\nreturn x will return a pending Promise, and it will be evaluated on the subsequent then.\r\nRead more on this topic on the [Promise.prototype.then()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then) docs.\r\n\r\n### Another super basic implementation of Promise function, returning the resolve() immediately. Of note here how if a single string is passed to resolve() - then that would be returned\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst a3 = new Promise(resolve => {\r\n  resolve(\"Resolved Immediately\")\r\n})\r\n\r\nconsole.log(a3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput of above :-\r\n**Promise { 'Resolved Immediately' }**\r\n\r\n#### EXPLANATION - Promise resolve() method:\r\n\r\nPromise.resolve() method in JS returns a Promise object that is resolved with a given value. Any of the following three things can happen:\r\n\r\n- 1.  If the value is a promise - then promise is returned.\r\n- 2. If the value has a “then” attached to the promise - then the returned promise will follow that “then” to till the final state.\r\n- 2. If the promise is fulfilled with its value, then that value will be returned.\r\n"

            "content": "### Transform the following code with sequential execution. I want to fire second request based on one value returned by the first request.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Fetch API provides an interface for making network requests, returning Promises for us to resolve. To use it to get the current weather in Long Beach, we chain together two then callbacks:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfetch(\"https://api.com/values/1\")\r\n  .then(response => response.json())\r\n  .then(json => console.log(json));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the first, we create a callback function to receive the Response object and return back its JSON data. In the second, we create a callback that receives that data and then logs it to the console.\r\n\r\nNeed to wrap it inside an async function to make the async-await mechanism work.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst request = async () => {\r\n  const response = await fetch(\"https://api.com/values/1\");\r\n  const json = await response.json();\r\n  console.log(json);\r\n};\r\n\r\nrequest();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the first line, we make a GET request to https://api.com/values/1. Instead of continuing to the next line, we wait for the request to finish, hence await. When it finishes, it passes the resolved value to the _response_ variable.\r\n\r\nIn the second line, we get the JSON version of the response. Again, we use await so we can wait for it to complete (or fail) and then pass the result to the json variable.\r\n\r\n**By wrapping the logic inside an async function, we can replace the then callbacks with await statements. The effect, the code pauses execution on those lines until the Promises resolve! Asynchronous programming becomes synchronous!**\r\n\r\nAsync/Await enables us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous fashion, which produces cleaner and easier-to-understand logic. Under the hood, it’s just syntactic sugar using [generators and yield statements to “pause” execution](https://tc39.github.io/ecmascript-asyncawait/#async-function-definitions). In other words, async functions can “pull out” the value of a Promise even though it’s nested inside a callback function, giving us the ability to assign it to a variable!\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\nhttps://dev.to/johnpaulada/synchronous-fetch-with-asyncawait\r\n"

The syntactic sugar of async/await is backed by Promises which means we could also look at our code as doing something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nhandleForm = event => {\r\n    this.setState({ isProcessing: true });\r\n    client.sendApiRequest({\r\n      value1: event.target.elements.field1.value,\r\n      value2: event.target.elements.field2.value,\r\n    }).then(response => {\r\n      if (response.ok)\r\n        this.setState({ isProcessing: false });\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first part of that promise is going to execute in what is essentially a synchronous manner. That means we are safe to pass the event values as arguments.\r\n\r\n#### However, it’s important to recognize that this does not mean that accessing the event values anywhere in an async function is okay. Take for example what would happen if we needed access the event after the API request.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nhandleForm = async event => {\r\n  this.setState({ isProcessing: true });\r\n  const response = await client.sendApiRequest({\r\n    value1: event.target.elements.field1.value,\r\n    value2: event.target.elements.field2.value\r\n  });\r\n  if (response.ok) {\r\n    this.setState({\r\n      isProcessing: false,\r\n      value1: event.target.elements.field1.value,\r\n      value2: event.target.elements.field2.value\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Now we’re accessing the event after the await, which is like accessing it in the .then chain of a promise. We would be accessing the event asynchronously now.\r\n\r\nHere’s that same event written as promises again:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nhandleForm = event => {\r\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n    this.setState({ isProcessing: true });\r\n    client\r\n      .sendApiRequest({\r\n        value1: event.target.elements.field1.value,\r\n        value2: event.target.elements.field2.value\r\n      })\r\n      .then(response => {\r\n        if (response.ok) {\r\n          this.setState({\r\n            isProcessing: false,\r\n            value1: event.target.elements.field1.value,\r\n            value2: event.target.elements.field2.value\r\n          });\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n1> https://medium.com/@ian.mundy/async-event-handlers-in-react-a1590ed24399\r\n2> https://medium.com/@tkssharma/writing-neat-asynchronous-node-js-code-with-promises-async-await-fa8d8b0bcd7c - Very Good\r\n"

Here’s an example of something we were doing previously:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncomponentWillUpdate(nextProps) {\r\n    if (!nextProps.user.isLogged && !nextProps.user.authenticating) {\r\n        this.context.router.history.push('/')\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, replacing that usage with **componentDidUpdate**:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncomponentDidUpdate(/*prevProps, prevState*/) {\r\n  if (!this.props.user.isLogged && !this.props.user.authenticating) {\r\n    this.context.router.history.push('/')\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**componentDidUpdate** is similar to **componentDidMount** except that is caused after a change in state or props occurs instead of just on initial mount. As opposed to **getDerivedStateFromProps**, we have access to the context provided by **this**. Note that this method also has arguments for prevProps and prevState, which provides the previous versions of the component’s props and state for comparison to the current values.\r\n"

This is because of the eventual migration of React to async rendering; these lifecycle methods will become unreliable when async rendering is made default.\r\n\r\nIn place of these methods, the new static method **getDerivedStateFromProps** was introduced.\r\n\r\n**getDerivedStateFromProps** is invoked every time a component is rendered. It takes in two arguments: the next props object (which may be the same as the previous object) and the previous state object of the component in question. When implementing this method, we need to return the changes to our component state or null (or {}) if no changes need to be made.\r\n\r\n### Need to keep in mind that the new method is static, and therefore does not have access to the this context that the old lifecycle methods provided.\r\n\r\nAnd you can either return an object to update the state of the component:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstatic getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {\r\n    return {\r\n        points: 200 // update state with this\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Remember, this method is called (or invoked) before the component is rendered to the DOM on initial mount.\r\n\r\nBelow’s a quick example:\r\n\r\nConsider a simple component that renders the number of points scored by a football team.\r\n\r\nAs you may have expected, the number of points is stored in the component state object:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass App extends Component {\r\n  state = {\r\n    points: 10\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"App\">\r\n        <header className=\"App-header\">\r\n          <img src={logo} className=\"App-logo\" alt=\"logo\" />\r\n          <p>You've scored {this.state.points} points.</p>\r\n        </header>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of this is the following: **You've scored 10 points**\r\n\r\nNow, if you put in the static getDerivedStateFromProps method as shown below.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass App extends Component {\r\n  state = {\r\n    points: 10\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  // *******\r\n  //  NB: Not the recommended way to use this method. Just an example. Unconditionally overriding state here is generally considered a bad idea\r\n  // ********\r\n  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {\r\n    return {\r\n      points: 1000\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"App\">\r\n        <header className=\"App-header\">\r\n          <img src={logo} className=\"App-logo\" alt=\"logo\" />\r\n          <p>You've scored {this.state.points} points.</p>\r\n        </header>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now, we have the static **getDerivedStateFromProps** component life-cycle method in there. If you remember from the previous explanation, this method is called before the component is mounted to the DOM. By returning an object, we update the state of the component before it is even rendered.\r\n\r\nAnd here’s what we get: **You've scored 1000 points**\r\n\r\nWith the 1000 coming from updating state within the static getDerivedStateFromProps method.\r\n\r\nWell, this example is contrived, and not really the way you’d use the static getDerivedStateFromProps method. I just wanted to make sure you understood the basics first.\r\n\r\nWith this lifecycle method, just because you can update state doesn’t mean you should go ahead and do this. There are specific use cases for the static getDerivedStateFromProps method, or you’ll be solving a problem with the wrong tool.\r\n\r\nSo when should you use the static **getDerivedStateFromProps** lifecycle method?\r\n\r\nEssentially, this method allows a component to update its internal state in response to a change in props. Also, component state in this manner is referred to as Derived State.\r\n\r\nAs a rule of thumb, derived state should be used sparingly as you can introduce subtle bugs into your application if you aren’t sure of what you’re doing.\r\n\r\n#### An actual real-world example comparing it with the previous method\r\n\r\nHere’s a pattern we were using in many components throughout our codebase:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncomponentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\r\n  if (nextProps.selectedTab !== this.state.selectedTab) {\r\n    this.setState(() => { return {selectedTab: nextProps.selectedTab} })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis lifecycle method fired when we were about to receive new props in our component, passing in the new value as the first argument. We needed to check whether the new props indicated a change in the state of our tab bar, which we stored in state. This is one of the simplest patterns to address with getDerivedStateFromProps:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstatic getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState) {\r\n  return nextProps.selectedTab === prevState.selectedTab\r\n    ? {}\r\n    : {selectedTab: nextProps.selectedTab}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code works in exactly the same way, but, since it’s static, we no longer use the context provided by this. Instead, we return any state changes. In this case, I’ve returned an empty object ({}) to indicate no state change when the tabs are identical; otherwise, I return an object with the new selectedTab value.\r\n"

It is important to note that setting the state in this phase **WILL NOT TRIGGER a RE-RENDERING**.\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncomponentWillMount();\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `setState()` can be called here and won't cause a rerender\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##### componentDidMount\r\n\r\nAs soon as the render method has been executed the componentDidMount function is called. The DOM can be accessed in this method, enabling to define DOM manipulations or data fetching operations. Any DOM interactions should always happen in this phase not inside the render method.\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncomponentDidMount();\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Access self and child `ref`s (`componentDidMount()` bubbles up)\r\n- Set listeners and timers\r\n- Make AJAX requests\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### componentDidMount() is the best place to put calls to fetch data (as against componentWillMount ), for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- Using DidMount makes it clear that data won’t be loaded until after the initial render. This reminds you to set up initial state properly, so you don’t end up with undefined state that causes errors.\r\n- If on the other hand, I put a fetch network call inside componentWillMount - then a situation may arise when an asynchronous call to fetch data will not return before the render happens. This means the component will render with empty data at least once. There is no way to “pause” rendering to wait for data to arrive.\r\n\r\n- If you ever need to render your app on the server (SSR/isomorphic/other buzzwords), componentWillMount will actually be called twice – once on the server, and again on the client – which is probably not what you want. Putting the data loading code in componentDidMount will ensure that data is only fetched from the client.\r\n\r\n## Updating\r\n\r\n##### componentWillReceiveProps\r\n\r\n**componentWillReceiveProps** gets executed when the props have changed and is not first render. Sometimes state depends on the props, hence whenever props changes the state should also be synced. This is the method where it should be done.\r\nThe similar method for the state doesn’t exist before state change because the props are read only within a component and can never be dependent on the state.\r\nUsage: This is how the state can be kept synced with the new props.\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncomponentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\r\n    if (this.props.status !== this.props.nextProps) {\r\n        this.setState({\r\n            state: nextProps.status\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Use to compare upcoming, new props (`nextProps.prop`) with old (`this.props.prop`)\r\n- `setState()` (especially in response to a prop change) can be called here and won't cause a re-render\r\n\r\n##### shouldComponentUpdate\r\n\r\n### This method should return true or false, and accordingly the component would be re-rendered or skipped.\r\n\r\n`shouldComponentUpdate` is always called before the render method and enables to define if a re-rendering is needed or can be skipped. So it is called after props or state are changed (and after componentWillReceiveProps), but before it renders. It’s unique among lifecycle functions in that it is expected to return a boolean value. If false, render will not be called. This can be very useful for skipping unnecessary renders and save some CPU.\r\nObviously this method is never called on initial rendering. A boolean value must be returned. Access to the upcoming as well as the current props and state ensure that possible changes can be detected to determine if a rendering is needed or not.\r\n\r\nThis method is generally used when rendering is a very heavy method, then you should avoid render every now and then. For example, suppose for every render, the component generates thousand prime numbers, let’s consider some app has this kind of logic, then we can control when it is required then only the component is rendered.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nboolean shouldComponentUpdate(\r\n  object nextProps, object nextState\r\n) { return statement }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A code example of shouldComponentUpdate\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Scorecard extends Component {\r\n  // Other functions omitted for brevity.\r\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\r\n    // Same as `componentWillReceiveProps`, `nextProps` is the\r\n    // new props and `this.props` is the old.\r\n    const { playerName } = this.props;\r\n    // Ditto for `nextState` and `this.state`.\r\n    const { score } = this.state;\r\n    // Only `playerName` and `score` affect the display.\r\n    // If something else changes, re-rendering would be a waste.\r\n    return !(nextProps.playerName === playerName && nextState.score === score);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Another code example of shouldComponentUpdate\r\n\r\n```js\r\nshouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\r\n  let shouldUpdate = this.props.status !== nextProps.status;\r\n  return shouldUpdate;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Unless `forceUpdate` is used, can be used to block a render cycle. `componentWillUpdate` and `componentDidUpdate` will not be called - Use to increase performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##### componentWillUpdate\r\n\r\ncomponentWillUpdate gets called as soon as the the shouldComponentUpdate returned true. Any state changes via this.setState are not allowed as this method should be strictly used to prepare for an upcoming update not trigger an update itself.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvoid componentWillUpdate(\r\n  object nextProps, object nextState\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Cannot use this.setState() in this method\r\n- Opportunity to perform preparation before an update occurs\r\n\r\n##### componentDidUpdate\r\n\r\ncomponentDidUpdate is called after the render method. Similar to the componentDidMount, this method can be used to perform DOM operations after the data has been updated.\r\n\r\ncomponentDidUpdate: function(prevProps, prevState){\r\n//\r\n}\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### render\r\n\r\nThe render method returns the needed component markup, which can be a single child component or null or false (in case you don't want any rendering).\r\n\r\nThis is the part of the lifecycle where props and state values are interpreted to create the correct output. Neither props nor state should should be modified inside this function. This is important to remember, as by definition the render function has to be pure, meaning that the same result is returned every time the method is invoked.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the render method has been executed the componentDidMount function is called.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrender()\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The update method.\r\n- Safely read from `props` and `state` here\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n```\r\ncomponentDidUpdate(prevProps = {},  prevState = {})\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Operate on the DOM after an update in this Method\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Unmounting\r\n\r\n#### componentWillUnmount\r\n\r\nThis method is the last method in the lifecycle. This is executed just before the component gets removed from the DOM.\r\nUsage: In this method, we do all the cleanups related to the component.\r\nFor example, on logout, the user details and all the auth tokens can be cleared before unmounting the main component.\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncomponentWillUnmount() {\r\n    this.chart.destroy()\r\n    this.resetLocalStorage();\r\n    this.clearSession();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- DOM cleanup\r\n- listener removal & timer removal\r\n"

When a component gets mounted to the DOM or unmounted from it.\r\n\r\n2. When a component receives new data.\r\n\r\nFor the first category, the component may need to perform some/all of the following tasks during that time in the life cycle:\r\n\r\n* Default props - if props aren’t given to a component, they default to the specified Component.defaultProps object.\r\n\r\n* Initial State - initial state is retrieved from within the constructor of the component\r\n\r\n* Make an Ajax request to fetch some data - common use case, the request can be made in the body of componentDidMount method\r\n\r\n* Set up or remove any listeners or web-sockets (like a firebase ref listener) - start listener within componentDidMount and stop listener in componentWillUnmount\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mounting - After preparing with basic needs, state and props, our React Component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase gives hook methods for before and after mounting of components.\r\n\r\n- constructor()\r\n- componentWillMount()\r\n- render()\r\n- componentDidMount()\r\n\r\n### Updating - This phase starts when the react component has taken birth on the browser and grows by receiving new updates. The component can be updated by two ways, sending new props or updating the state.\r\n\r\n- componentWillReceiveProps()\r\n- shouldComponentUpdate()\r\n- componentWillUpdate()\r\n- render()\r\n- componentDidUpdate()\r\n\r\n### Unmounting\r\n\r\ncomponentWillUnmount()\r\n\r\n\r\nNow coming to the life cycle events that triggered when the component receives new data from its parent component.\r\n\r\n* `componentWillReceiveProps` - for times when you want to execute some code whenever your component receives props\r\n\r\n* `shouldComponentUpdate` - allows us to add another condition which should return true for react to re-render that component (and obviously its children)\r\n\r\n\r\n| Method | Side effects<sup>1</sup> | State updates<sup>2</sup> | Example uses |\r\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |\r\n| <big>**Mounting**</big> |\r\n| `componentWillMount` |  | ✓ | Constructor equivalent for `createClass ` |\r\n| `render` |  |  | Create and return element(s) |\r\n| `componentDidMount` | ✓ | ✓ | DOM manipulations, network requests, etc. |\r\n| <big>**Updating**</big> |\r\n| `componentWillReceiveProps` |  | ✓ | Update `state` based on changed `props` |\r\n| `shouldComponentUpdate` |  |  | Compare inputs and determine if render needed |\r\n| `componentWillUpdate` |  |  | Set/reset things (eg cached values) before next render |\r\n| `render` |  |  | Create and return element(s) |\r\n| `componentDidUpdate` | ✓ | ✓ | DOM manipulations, network requests, etc. |\r\n| <big>**Unmounting**</big> |\r\n| `componentWillUnmount` | ✓ |  | DOM manipulations, network requests, etc. |\r\n\r\n[React Component Life-Cycle official Doc](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html).\r\n\r\n1. \"Side effects\" refer to modifying variables outside of the instance, async operations, etc.\r\n2. \"State updates\" refer to the current instance only (eg `this.setState`).\r\n\r\n![react component's life cycle events](http://i.imgur.com/3LkFtGd.png)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"component-life-cycle.jpeg\">"

What shouldComponentUpdate does is it’s a lifecycle method that allows us to opt out of this reconciliation process for certain components (and their child components). Why would we ever want to do this? As mentioned above, “The end goal of reconciliation is to, in the most efficient way possible, update the UI based on new state”. If we know that a certain section of our UI isn’t going to change, there’s no reason to have React go through the trouble of trying to figure out if it should. By returning false from shouldComponentUpdate, React will assume that the current component, and all its child components, will stay the same as they currently are.\r\n\r\n## How shouldComponentUpdate boost performance\r\n\r\nhttps://hackernoon.com/virtual-dom-in-reactjs-43a3fdb1d130\r\n\r\n### ReactJS uses observable’s to find the modified components. Whenever setState() method is called on any component, ReactJS makes that component dirty and re-renders it.\r\n\r\n## At any given time, ReactJS maintains two virtual DOM, one with the updated state Virtual DOM and other with the previous state Virtual DOM.\r\n\r\nReactJS using diff algorithm compares both the Virtual DOM to find the minimum number of steps to update the Real DOM.\r\n\r\nReactJS uses following steps to find the difference in both the Virtual DOM’s\r\n\r\n### Re-render all the children if parent state has changed. If the state of a component has changed, then ReactJS re-renders all the child components even if child components are not modified. To prevent the unwanted re-render of the child components we can use shouldComponentUpdate() component life cycle method. This will further help in boosting the performance.\r\n\r\n"

One of the trade-offs of this is that componentWillMount, the other lifecycle event where it might make sense to make an AJAX request, will be “non-deterministic”. What this means is that React may start calling componentWillMount at various times whenever it feels like it needs to. This would obviously be a bad formula for AJAX requests.\r\n\r\nYou can’t guarantee the AJAX request won’t resolve before the component mounts. If it did, that would mean that you’d be trying to setState on an unmounted component, which not only won’t work, but React will yell at you for. Doing AJAX in componentDidMount will guarantee that there’s a component to update."

            "content": "### [What is Shallow Comparison from Official dox](https://reactjs.org/docs/shallow-compare.html)\r\n\r\n-   A> When shallow comparing scalar values (numbers, strings) it compares their values. When comparing objects, it does not compare their attributes - only their references are compared (e.g. \"do they point to same object?).\r\n\r\n-   B> Shallow comparison is when the properties of the objects being compared is done using \"===\" or strict equality and will not conduct comparisons deeper into the properties. So if you shallow compare a deep nested object it will just check the reference not the values inside that object.\r\n\r\n-   C> shallowCompare performs a shallow equality check on the current props and nextProps objects as well as the current state and nextState objects.\r\n    It does this by iterating on the keys of the objects being compared and returning true (i.e. the component SHOULD GET UPDATED ) when the values of a key in each object are not strictly equal.\r\n\r\n    shallowCompare returns true if the shallow comparison for props or state fails and therefore the component should update.\r\n    shallowCompare returns false if the shallow comparison for props and state both pass and therefore the component does not need to update.\r\n    .\r\n\r\n#### useEffect and shallow comparison\r\n\r\nuseEffect‘s primary goal is to encompass any side effect you might want to use. A side effect is essentially something that you do within your component which affects the world at large. Whether that’s a network request, setting the document title, or what have you.\r\n\r\n**When does it run?** - when the component re-renders, useEffect will check dependencies. If the dependency values changed, useEffect will run the effect\r\n\r\n**What’s the catch?** React does a shallow comparison. If you use an object or an array that you mutate, React will think nothing changed. Because objects are compared by reference.\r\n\r\nImportant features useEffect skips running the effect when things don’t change. You don’t actually have to use the dependency values in the effect. You can pass in a prop value as a dependency.\r\n\r\n### Now how does shallow comparison works in React\r\n\r\nShallow compare does check for equality. When comparing scalar values (numbers, strings) it compares their values. When comparing objects, it does not compare their's attributes - only their references are compared (e.g. \"do they point to same object in memory ?).\r\n\r\nLet's consider following shape of user object\r\n\r\n```js\r\nuser = {\r\n\tname: \"John\",\r\n\tsurname: \"Doe\"\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example 1:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst user = this.state.user;\r\nuser.name = \"Jane\";\r\n\r\nconsole.log(user === this.state.user); // true\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice you changed users name. Even with this change objects are equal. They references are exactly same. Meaning no change and no re-render\r\n\r\n**Example 2:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst user = clone(this.state.user);\r\nconsole.log(user === this.state.user); // false\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, without any changes to object properties they are completely different. By cloning original object you create new copy, with different reference.\r\n\r\nAnd the clone function might look as this (ES6 syntax)\r\n\r\n`const clone = obj => Object.assign({}, ...obj);`\r\n\r\nShallow compare is efficient way to detect changes. It expect you don't mutate data.\r\n\r\n`shallowCompare()` function in React actually works like this (just what the official doc says above) - iterating on the keys of the objects being compared and returning true (i.e. saying that the objects are different meaning a re-render is necessary ) when the values of a key in each object are not strictly equal.\r\n\r\n### Further Reading\r\n\r\n-   1.

You can replicate this behavior by combining the function updater form with object spread syntax:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsetState((prevState) => {\r\n  // Object.assign would also work\r\n  return { ...prevState, ...updatedValues }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother option is useReducer, which is more suited for managing state objects that contain multiple sub-values.\r\n\r\n### The key point and guidance to update states\r\n\r\nJust as with setState in a class component you need to be careful when updating state derived from something that already is in state i.e. your new state depends on the old state. State updates using hooks are also batched and hence whenever you want to update state based on previous one its better to use the callback pattern.\r\n\r\nThe callback pattern to update state also comes in handy when the setter doesn't receive updated value from enclosed closure due to it being defined only once. An example of such as case if the useEffect being called only on initial render when adds a listener that updates state on an event.\r\n\r\nIf you e.g. update a count twice in a row, it will not work as expected if you don't use the function version of updating the state.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { useState } = React\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\r\n\r\n  // This will be bad, might lead to more bugs because such code often end up inside a closure which has an outdated value of myState.\r\n  function brokenIncrement() {\r\n    setCount(count + 1)\r\n    setCount(count + 1)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // The recommended way is to use a function to update the state\r\n  function increment() {\r\n    setCount((count) => count + 1)\r\n    setCount((count) => count + 1)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <div>{count}</div>\r\n      <button onClick={brokenIncrement}>Broken increment</button>\r\n      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById(\"root\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Reference\r\n\r\n- [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55342406/updating-and-merging-state-object-using-react-usestate-hook](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55342406/updating-and-merging-state-object-using-react-usestate-hook)\r\n-\r\n"

The state and state update function come from the state hook called useState that is responsible to manage the local state for the data that we are going to fetch for the App component. The initial state is an empty list of hits in an object that represents the data. No one is setting any state for this data yet.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\r\nimport axios from \"axios\";\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  const [data, setData] = useState({ hits: [] });\r\n\r\n  useEffect(async () => {\r\n    const result = await axios(\r\n      \"http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=redux\"\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    setData(result.data);\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <ul>\r\n      {data.hits.map(item => (\r\n        <li key={item.objectID}>\r\n          <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>\r\n        </li>\r\n      ))}\r\n    </ul>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe effect hook called useEffect is used to fetch the data with axios from the API and to set the data in the local state of the component with the state hook’s update function. The promise resolving happens with async/await.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you run your application, you should stumble into a nasty loop with the above implementation of **useEffect()**. The effect hook runs when the component mounts but also when the component updates. Because we are setting the state after every data fetch, the component updates and the effect runs again. It fetches the data again and again. That’s a bug and needs to be avoided. **We only want to fetch data when the component mounts. That’s why you can provide an empty array as second argument to the effect hook to avoid activating it on component updates but only for the mounting of the component.**\r\n\r\nThe second argument can be used to define all the variables (allocated in this array) on which the hook depends. If one of the variables changes, the hook runs again. If the array with the variables is empty, the hook doesn’t run when updating the component at all, because it doesn’t have to watch any variables.\r\n\r\nThere is one last catch. In the code, we are using async/await to fetch data from a third-party API. According to the documentation every function annotated with async returns an implicit promise: “The async function declaration defines an asynchronous function, which returns an AsyncFunction object. An asynchronous function is a function which operates asynchronously via the event loop, using an implicit Promise to return its result.\r\n\r\n**However, an useEffect() function must not return anything besides a function, which is used for clean-up. That when useEffect() does return a function that function is ONLY used for cleaning up, like what we will do under componentWillUnmount()**\r\n\r\nThat’s why you may see the following warning in your developer console log: 07:41:22.910 index.js:1452 Warning: useEffect function must return a cleanup function or nothing. Promises and useEffect(async () => …) are not supported, but you can call an async function inside an effect.. That’s why using async directly in the useEffect function isn’t allowed. Let’s implement a workaround for it, by using the async function inside the effect.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\r\nimport axios from \"axios\";\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  const [data, setData] = useState({ hits: [] });\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const fetchData = async () => {\r\n      const result = await axios(\r\n        \"http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=redux\"\r\n      );\r\n\r\n      setData(result.data);\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    fetchData();\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <ul>\r\n      {data.hits.map(item => (\r\n        <li key={item.objectID}>\r\n          <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>\r\n        </li>\r\n      ))}\r\n    </ul>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Great explanation of the second array argument to useEffect()\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/state-management-with-react-hooks-no-redux-or-context-api-8b3035ceecf8](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/state-management-with-react-hooks-no-redux-or-context-api-8b3035ceecf8)\r\n\r\n**By default, effects run after every completed render.

            "content": "### you can think of useEffect Hook as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined.\r\n\r\nMutations, subscriptions, timers, logging, and other side effects are not allowed inside the main body of a function component (referred to as React’s render phase). Doing so will lead to confusing bugs and inconsistencies in the UI. **According to doc function passed to useEffect fires after layout and paint.**\r\n\r\n[https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) - The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components. Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of side effects.\r\n\r\nIn React class components, the render method itself shouldn’t cause side effects. It would be too early — we typically want to perform our effects after React has updated the DOM.\r\n\r\nThis is why in React classes, we put side effects into componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.\r\n\r\n### Effects Without Cleanup {#effects-without-cleanup}\r\n\r\nSometimes, we want to **run some additional code after React has updated the DOM.** Network requests, manual DOM mutations, and logging are common examples of effects that don't require a cleanup. We say that because we can run them and immediately forget about them. Let's compare how classes and Hooks let us express such side effects.\r\n\r\n### Example Using Classes {#example-using-classes}\r\n\r\nIn React class components, the `render` method itself shouldn't cause side effects. It would be too early -- we typically want to perform our effects _after_ React has updated the DOM.\r\nThis is why in React classes, we put side effects into `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`. Coming back to our example, here is a React counter class component that updates the document title right after React makes changes to the DOM:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Example extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      count: 0\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;\r\n  }\r\n  componentDidUpdate() {\r\n    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>\r\n        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>\r\n          Click me\r\n        </button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote how **we have to duplicate the code between these two lifecycle methods in class.**\r\nThis is because in many cases we want to perform the same side effect regardless of whether the component just mounted, or if it has been updated. Conceptually, we want it to happen after every render -- but React class components don't have a method like this. We could extract a separate method but we would still have to call it in two places.\r\n\r\nNow let's see how we can do the same with the `**useEffect**` Hook.\r\n\r\n### Example Using Hooks {#example-using-hooks}\r\n\r\nWe've already seen this example at the top of this page, but let's take a closer look at it:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction Example() {\r\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\r\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe state and state update function come from the state hook called useState\r\n\r\n**What does `useEffect` do?** By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we'll refer to it as our \"effect\"), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API.\r\n\r\n**Why is `useEffect` called inside a component?** Placing `useEffect` inside the component lets us access the `count` state variable (or any props) right from the effect. We don't need a special API to read it -- it's already in the function scope. Hooks embrace JavaScript closures and avoid introducing React-specific APIs where JavaScript already provides a solution.\r\n\r\n**Does `useEffect` run after every render?** Yes! By default, it runs both after the first render _and_ after every update. (We separately talk about below [how to customize this](#tip-optimizing-performance-by-skipping-effects). Instead of thinking in terms of \"mounting\" and \"updating\", you might find it easier to think that effects happen \"after render\". React guarantees the DOM has been updated by the time it runs the effects.\r\n\r\n#### Great explanation of the second array (called the dependencies array) argument to useEffect() - so to control when useEffect() will run\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/state-management-with-react-hooks-no-redux-or-context-api-8b3035ceecf8](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/state-management-with-react-hooks-no-redux-or-context-api-8b3035ceecf8)\r\n\r\n**By default, effects run after every completed render. But, you can choose to fire it only when certain values have changed, passing an array of variables as a second optional parameter.**\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Without the second parameter\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  console.log(\"I will run after every render\");\r\n});\r\n\r\n// With the second parameter\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  console.log(\"I will run only when valueA changes\");\r\n}, [valueA]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**The reason we need to pass in an empty array as the second argument to useEffect** -\r\n\r\nFrom the react [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#conditionally-firing-an-effect):\r\n\r\nPassing in an empty array [] of inputs tells React that your effect doesn’t depend on any values from the component, so that effect would run only on mount and clean up on unmount; it won’t run on updates.\r\nIf you want to run an effect and clean it up only once (on mount and unmount), you can pass an empty array ([]) as a second argument. This tells React that your effect doesn’t depend on any values from props or state, so it never needs to re-run. This isn’t handled as a special case — it follows directly from how the dependencies array always works.\r\n\r\nIf you pass an empty array ([]), the props and state as inside the effect will always have their initial values. While passing [] as the second argument is closer to the familiar componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount mental model, there are usually better solutions to avoid re-running effects too often. Also, don’t forget that React defers running useEffect until after the browser has painted, so doing extra work is less of a problem.\r\n\r\nThis (passing the empty array) typically is used to control whether or not the useEffect needs to be re-applied. This array is diffed from the original creation of the effect and the new one being passed in. It will diff the array (just like it does the virtual DOM) and decide if it needs to re-apply the effect.\r\n\r\nPassing in an empty array tells React to diff, however there is nothing different between each render so the effect will only be run once. Be aware though, if you are calling a function from props, or relying on props inside the effect you will need to pass them into the array to re-apply the effect.\r\n"

            "content": "#### The problem around dependency array\r\n\r\nI trying to wrap my head around the new hooks api of react. Specifically, I'm trying to construct the classic use case that once was the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncomponentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\r\n    if (prevProps.foo !== this.props.foo) {\r\n        // animate dom elements here...\r\n        this.animateSomething(this.ref, this.props.onAnimationComplete);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, I tried to build the same with a function component and useEffect, but can't figure out how to do it. This is what I tried:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  animateSomething(ref, props.onAnimationComplete);\r\n}, [props.foo]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, the effect is only called when props.foo changes. And that does work – BUT! It appears to be an anti-pattern since the eslint-plugin-react-hooks marks this as an error. All dependencies that are used inside the effect should be declared in the dependencies array. So that means I would have to do the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  animateSomething(ref, props.onAnimationComplete);\r\n}, [props.foo, ref, props.onAnimationComplete]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat does not lead to the linting error BUT it totally defeats the purpose of only calling the effect when props.foo changes. I don't WANT it to be called when the other props or the ref change.\r\n\r\n#### The Solution\r\n\r\nconst previousFooRef = useRef(props.foo);\r\n\r\n```js\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  if (previousFooRef.current !== props.foo) {\r\n    animateSomething(ref, props.onAnimationComplete);\r\n    previousFooRef.current = props.foo;\r\n  }\r\n}, [props.foo, props.onAnimationComplete]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can't avoid the complexity of having a condition inside the effect, because without it you will run your animation on mount rather than just when props.foo changes. The condition also allows you to avoid animating when things other than props.foo change.\r\n\r\nBy including props.onAnimationComplete in the dependencies array, you avoid disabling the lint rule which helps ensure that you don’t introduce future bugs related to missing dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Further Reading\r\n\r\n- 1.

Don't do this.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n- 1.  [https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14324](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14324)\r\n- 2.\r\n"

In other words, Whatever function we return from the useEffect will be treated as componentWillUnmount and will run either when the useEffect runs again or when the component is about to leave the UI.**\r\n**So to clean up the side effects you must return a function.**\r\n\r\n**we can also use as many useEffect we want to add. That means you can subscribe to an event and unsubscribe from it inside one useEffect and hit APIs in another useEffect**\r\n[Source](https://medium.com/recraftrelic/usestate-and-useeffect-explained-cdb5dc252baf)\r\n\r\nAs we discussed previously, we need to pass an empty list as the second argument for useEffect so that the callback will only be called once. This apply to the returned function too.\r\n\r\nNormally we do cleanups in the componentWillUnmount.\r\n\r\n#### Example - create an event listener on componentDidMount and clean it up on componentDidUnmount. With hooks the code will be combined into one callback function.\r\n\r\nTo get setup we'll create two hooks to help test out how the useEffect hook operates. One will trigger a simple state update to re-render. The other will control unmounting of our child component (named Position) we'll create.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nconst App = () => {\r\n  const [trigger, setTrigger] = useState(true);\r\n  const [mounted, setMount] = useState(true);\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <button onClick={() => setTrigger(!trigger)}>Trigger Update</button>\r\n      <button onClick={() => setMount(!mounted)}>Toggle Mount</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the Child Component Position\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst logMousePosition = e => {\r\n  console.log({\r\n    x: e.clientX,\r\n    y: e.clientY\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst Position = () => {\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    window.addEventListener(\"mousemove\", logMousePosition);\r\n    console.log('Created);\r\n    return () => {\r\n        console.log('Cleaned up');\r\n        window.removeEventListener('mousemove', logMousePosition)\r\n    }\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  return null;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nA> The reason we have to clean up here - We want to avoid attaching an endless amount of event listeners so we'll use the clean up phase of the effect. Every time the component re-renders all effects will be re-run. To clean up the side effects you must return a function.\r\n\r\nB> The reason we need to pass in an empty array as the second argument to useEffect - If you run the code without the second empty list of array everything will work, however when you trigger an update. You can see with our console logs that the clean up phase is run. We don't need to keep attaching and detaching the listeners.\r\nSo, in order to register just once we need to pass in an empty array as the second argument to useEffect.\r\n\r\nThis (passing the empty array) typically is used to control whether or not the useEffect needs to be re-applied. This array is diffed from the original creation of the effect and the new one being passed in. It will diff the array (just like it does the virtual DOM) and decide if it needs to re-apply the effect.\r\n\r\nPassing in an empty array tells React to diff, however there is nothing different between each render so the effect will only be run once. Be aware though, if you are calling a function from props, or relying on props inside the effect you will need to pass them into the array to re-apply the effect.\r\n\r\n**For example if you were relying on an id inside the effect you'd pass in [props.id] and React will take care of re-applying it for you.**\r\n\r\n##### Final Implementation\r\n\r\nFinally to prove that React is cleaning up our effects when the component unmounts you can toggle the rendering of our Position component. You can see that when you unmount it, Cleaned up will be logged and our mouse movements will no longer be logged.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst App = () => {\r\n  const [trigger, setTrigger] = useState(true);\r\n  const [mounted, setMount] = useState(true);\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <button onClick={() => setTrigger(!trigger)}>Trigger Update</button>\r\n      <button onClick={() => setMount(!mounted)}>Toggle Mount</button>\r\n\r\n      {mounted ? <Position /> : null}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n- 1.

In order to replicate the same behaviour, you can make use of the a similar pattern like componentDidUpdate lifecycle method in React class components with useEffect using Hooks\r\n\r\nuseEffect hooks takes the second parameter as an array of values which React needs to monitor for change after the render cycle is complete.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\ndoSomething(); // This is be executed when `loading` state changes\r\n}, [loading])\r\nsetLoading(true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther, Unlike setState, the updater for useState hook doesn't have a callback, but you can always use a useEffect to replicate the above behaviour. However you need to determine the loading change\r\n\r\nThe functional approach to your code would look like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction usePrevious(value) {\r\n  const ref = useRef();\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    ref.current = value;\r\n  });\r\n  return ref.current;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst prevLoading = usePrevious(isLoading);\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  if (!prevLoading && isLoading) {\r\n    getOrders({\r\n      page: page + 1,\r\n      query: localQuery,\r\n      held: localHoldMode,\r\n      statuses: filterMap[filterBy]\r\n    })\r\n      .then(o => {\r\n        const { orders: fetchedOrders } = o.data;\r\n        const allOrders = orders.concat(fetchedOrders);\r\n\r\n        setOrders(allOrders);\r\n        setPage(page + 1);\r\n        setPagesSeen([...pagesSeen, page + 1]);\r\n        setPrefetchedOrders(null);\r\n        setIsLoading(false);\r\n      })\r\n      .catch(e => console.error(e.message));\r\n  }\r\n}, [isLoading, preFetchedOrders, orders, page, pagesSeen]);\r\n\r\nconst getNextPage = () => {\r\n  // This will scroll back to the top, and also trigger the prefetch for the next page on the way up.\r\n  goToTop();\r\n\r\n  if (pagesSeen.includes(page + 1)) {\r\n    return setPage(page + 1);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  if (prefetchedOrders) {\r\n    const allOrders = orders.concat(prefetchedOrders);\r\n    setOrders(allOrders);\r\n    setPage(page + 1);\r\n    setPagesSeen([...pagesSeen, page + 1]);\r\n    setPrefetchedOrders(null);\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  setIsLoading(true);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo now the question is - in the case of having multiple **setStates** that we want to wait for, we need multiple **useEffect** hooks.\r\nIf you want to take different actions when different states change then yes, we need multiple useEffect() hooks, but if you want to do the sme thing on any of those multiple states change, then you could pass multiple arguments like [isLoading, isUpdated, showError]\r\n"

            "content": "**useReducer hook accepts two arguments first argument is reducer function and second argument is initial app state then it return array with two elements - state and a dispatch function.**\r\n\r\nA Reducer Hook returns us a state object and a function to alter the state object. The function – called dispatch function – takes an action which has a type and an optional payload. All this information is used in the actual reducer function to distill a new state from the previous state, the action’s optional payload and type.\r\n\r\nGiven the return value from **useReducer** is in the form object, I can do de-structuring to get the named-properties from that object by doing this.\r\n\r\n`const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)`\r\n\r\n**reducer** is a function that takes a state and action and returns a newState. So the above signature of useReducer() effectively becomes the below\r\n\r\n`const [state, dispatch] = useReducer((state, action) => newState)`\r\n\r\nThe newState returned from the reducer is then consumed by the component via the state variable.\r\n\r\n[For the destructuring syntax by the](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#tip-what-do-square-brackets-mean)\r\n\r\nIt means that we’re making two new variables **state** and **dispatch**, where **state** is set to the first value returned by **useReducer**, and **dispatch** is the second. It is equivalent to this code:\r\n\r\nEvery useReducer comes with its own dispatch function. The **useReducer** function is tightly coupled to its reducer and its dispatch function. We dispatch action objects to that reducer only that useReducer() function takes as its first argument.\r\n\r\n#### Now an example to convert a useState() to a useReducer()\r\n\r\n[https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate)\r\n\r\n**First useState implementation of a typical counter button**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction Counter({ initialCount }) {\r\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      Count: {count}\r\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(initialCount)}>Reset</button>\r\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>+</button>\r\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1)}>-</button>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSyntax\r\n\r\n`const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init)`\r\n\r\nAn alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method.\r\n\r\nHere’s the counter example from the useState section, rewritten to use a reducer:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst initialState = { count: 0 };\r\n\r\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\r\n  switch (action.type) {\r\n    case \"increment\":\r\n      return { count: state.count + 1 };\r\n    case \"decrement\":\r\n      return { count: state.count - 1 };\r\n    default:\r\n      throw new Error();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Counter() {\r\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      Count: {state.count}\r\n      {/* dispatching the type of action*/}\r\n      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: \"increment\" })}>+</button>\r\n      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: \"decrement\" })}>-</button>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**A GENERAL EXAMPLE**\r\n\r\n**The dispatch function can be used to send an action to the reducer which would implicitly change the current state:**\r\n\r\n```JS\r\nconst [todos, dispatch] = React.useReducer(todoReducer, initialTodos);\r\n\r\ndispatch({ type: 'DO_TODO', id: 'a' });\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Compare it with how Redux dispatch() works\r\n\r\nDispatches an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change. dispatch() is one of the 4 methods of redux-store. dispatch() is the method used to dispatch actions and trigger state changes to the store. So the way we take `actions` to the `store` is `dispatch`\r\n\r\nThe store's reducing function will be called with the current getState() result and the given action synchronously. Its return value will be considered the next state. It will be returned from getState() from now on, and the change listeners will immediately be notified.\r\n\r\nThere are a few rules of thumb to follow: If you state management doesn’t need all the Redux features, use useState, useReducer and useContext. If your state management needs Redux as one global state container with middleware, introduce Redux to your application to handle state logic in complex and large applications.\r\n\r\n- Use useState for basic and simple/small size applications.\r\n- Use useState + useReducer + useContext for advanced/medium size applications.\r\n- Use useState/useReducer + Redux for complex/large size applications.\r\n\r\n#### Relation with useState\r\n\r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/a/55343617/1902852](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55343617/1902852)\r\n\r\nDigging thru the source code and the behavior is due to useState calling useReducer\r\n\r\nInternally, useState calls useReducer, which returns whatever state a reducer returns.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/2b93d686e3/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L1230\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n    useState<S>(\r\n      initialState: (() => S) | S,\r\n    ): [S, Dispatch<BasicStateAction<S>>] {\r\n      currentHookNameInDev = 'useState';\r\n        ...\r\n      try {\r\n        return updateState(initialState);\r\n      } finally {\r\n        ...\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere updateState is the internal implementation for useReducer.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction updateState<S>(\r\n  initialState: (() => S) | S,\r\n): [S, Dispatch<BasicStateAction<S>>] {\r\n  return updateReducer(basicStateReducer, (initialState: any));\r\n}\r\n\r\n    useReducer<S, I, A>(\r\n      reducer: (S, A) => S,\r\n      initialArg: I,\r\n      init?: I => S,\r\n    ): [S, Dispatch<A>] {\r\n      currentHookNameInDev = 'useReducer';\r\n      updateHookTypesDev();\r\n      const prevDispatcher = ReactCurrentDispatcher.current;\r\n      ReactCurrentDispatcher.current = InvalidNestedHooksDispatcherOnUpdateInDEV;\r\n      try {\r\n        return updateReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);\r\n      } finally {\r\n        ReactCurrentDispatcher.current = prevDispatcher;\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n- 1.

The useReducer function is tightly coupled to its reducer which holds also true for its dispatch function. We dispatch action objects to that reducer only. Whereas in Redux, the dispatch function sends the action object to the store which distributes it to all its combined reducer functions. You can think of Redux as one global event bus which takes any events (actions) and processes them into a new state based on the action’s payload and the previous state.\r\n\r\nIn other words, Redux provides a global store where you can keep app data centralized. useReducer is localized to a specific component.\r\n"

            "content": "#### First a super simple example\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nconst Message = () => {\r\n  const [messageState, setMessageState] = useState(\"\");\r\n  const [listState, setListState] = useState([]);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**useState** takes an initial state as an argument, and returns a pair (the current state and an updater function) as an array with two items. The first item is the current value, and the second is a function that lets us update it.\r\n\r\nIn the above case the current state is 'messageState' and the updater function is 'setMessageState'. This is similar to this.state.messageState and this.setState in a class component. The **array destructuring** syntax lets us give different names to the state variables we declared by calling useState. These names aren’t a part of the useState API.\r\n\r\nBy the [Official doc on the above array-destructuring syntax](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#tip-what-do-square-brackets-mean)\r\n\r\nIt means that we’re making two new variables **messageState** and **setMessateState**, where **messageState** is set to the first value returned by **useState**, and **setMessageState** is the second. It is equivalent to this code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar messageStateVariable = useState(\"some message\"); // Returns a pair\r\nvar messageState = messageStateVariable[0]; // First item in a pair\r\nvar setMessageState = messageStateVariable[1]; // Second item in a pair\r\n```\r\n\r\n**You can pass the initial value of the state variable as an argument directly, as shown in the previous example, or use a function to lazily initialize the variable (useful when the initial state is the result of an expensive computation):**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Message = () => {\r\n  const messageState = useState(() => expensiveComputation());\r\n  /* ... */\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**The initial value will be assigned only on the initial render (if it’s a function, it will be executed only on the initial render).**\r\n\r\n**In subsequent renders (due to a change of state in the component or a parent component), the argument of the useState hook will be ignored and the current value of the state will be retrieved. It is important to keep this in mind because, for example, if you want to update the state based on the new properties the component receives:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Message = props => {\r\n  const messageState = useState(props.message);\r\n  /_ ... _/;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above, Using useState alone won’t work because its argument is used the first time only, not every time the property changes. The issue will be, the state is being set upon component being loaded the first time. But when it receive new props, the state (props.message) will not get updated.\r\n\r\nLook below example taken from an SO question for the right way to do this. **You must make use of useEffect hooks to implement what you would call the componentWillReceiveProps/getDerivedStateFromProps functionality.**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Persons = props => {\r\n  // console.log(props.name);\r\n\r\n  const [nameState, setNameState] = useState(props);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    setNameState(props);\r\n  }, [props]);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        My name is {props.name} and my age is {props.age}\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>My profession is {props.profession}</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe **setNameState** function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value, as its argument and enqueues a re-render of the component. Remember unlike the class-based component's `setState()` method, there is NO `setState()` in react-hooks. So whatever the name of the state is (in this case 'nameState') just add the keyword **set** to that with a proper camel-casing. So here that becomes **setNameState** but this **setNameState** can theoretically be any word.\r\n\r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54625831/how-to-sync-props-to-state-using-react-hook-setstate](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54625831/how-to-sync-props-to-state-using-react-hook-setstate)\r\n\r\n### Some more explanation of useState and syntax\r\n\r\nStateful function components are enabled with the new function useState.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\r\nconst SomeComponent = props => {\r\n  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      {state} <input onChange={e => setState(e.target.value)} />\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nPere [Hooks Official Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) - **During the initial render, the returned state (state) is the same as the value passed as the first argument (initialState). During subsequent re-renders (i.e. after invoking a setState (like setCount or whatever) inside useEffect()), the first value returned by useState will always be, whatever is the most recent state after applying updates.**\r\n\r\nThe setState it returns is almost the same used by class components—it can accept a callback that gets the current state as an argument, but it doesn't automatically merge top-level object keys.\r\n\r\nEach call to useState is paired with a component, with its state persisting across renders. This means that you can call useState multiple times within a single function component to get multiple independent state values. Because the setState returned isn't scoped to a single component, we can define stateful behaviors independent of the component. This enables powerful new ways to abstract stateful logic.\r\n\r\n#### When we want to display the current count in a class, we read this.state.count:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**In a function, we can use 'count. directly - no need to use `this.state.count` - And as far as passing down props are concerned there is no difference in usage with React Hooks.**\r\n\r\n`<p>You clicked {count} times</p>`\r\n\r\n#### Updating State\r\n\r\nIn a class, we need to call this.setState() to update the count state:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>\r\n  Click me\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**In a function, we already have setCount and count as variables so we don’t need this:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n- [https://medium.com/@vcarl/everything-you-need-to-know-about-react-hooks-8f680dfd4349](https://medium.com/@vcarl/everything-you-need-to-know-about-react-hooks-8f680dfd4349)\r\n- [https://blog.logrocket.com/a-guide-to-usestate-in-react-ecb9952e406c](https://blog.logrocket.com/a-guide-to-usestate-in-react-ecb9952e406c)\r\n- [https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)\r\n- [https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate)\r\n"

            "content": "Since one of the core tenets of Redux is to never mutate state, you'll often find yourself using Object.assign() to create copies of objects with new or updated values. For example, in the todoApp below Object.assign() is used to return a new state object with an updated visibilityFilter property:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\r\n  switch (action.type) {\r\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\r\n      return Object.assign({}, state, {\r\n        visibilityFilter: action.filter\r\n      });\r\n    default:\r\n      return state;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile effective, using Object.assign() can quickly make simple reducers difficult to read given its rather verbose syntax.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach is to use the object spread syntax recently added to the JavaScript specification. It lets you use the spread (...) operator to copy enumerable properties from one object to another in a more succinct way. The object spread operator is conceptually similar to the ES6 array spread operator. We can simplify the todoApp example above by using the object spread syntax:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction todoApp(state = initialState, action) {\r\n  switch (action.type) {\r\n    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:\r\n      return { ...state, visibilityFilter: action.filter };\r\n    default:\r\n      return state;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe advantage of using the object spread syntax becomes more apparent when you're composing complex objects. Below getAddedIds maps an array of id values to an array of objects with values returned from getProduct and getQuantity.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nreturn getAddedIds(state.cart).map(id =>\r\n  Object.assign({}, getProduct(state.products, id), {\r\n    quantity: getQuantity(state.cart, id)\r\n  })\r\n);\r\n\r\n// Object spread lets us simplify the above map call to:\r\n\r\nreturn getAddedIds(state.cart).map(id => ({\r\n  ...getProduct(state.products, id),\r\n  quantity: getQuantity(state.cart, id)\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n"

            "content": "**In Redux all the application's state lives in one immutable state-tree called store.**\r\n\r\nThat store is at the fundamental level is a simple javascript object. And the reason its called **immutable** is because one does not simply modify the state tree. What we do is, we distribute action. **State is read-only**: The state cannot be changed directly by the view or any other process (maybe as a result of network callback or some other event). In order to change the state, you must express your intent by emitting an action. An action is a plain object describing your intent, and it contains a type property and some other data. Actions can be logged and later replayed which makes it good for debugging and testing purpose.\r\n\r\n### Why Immutable function and Immutable, persistent data-structure is so important in React\r\n\r\nOne approach to controlling changes is to favor immutable, persistent data structures. They seem to be a particularly good fit with React's virtual DOM approach.\r\n\r\nThe thing about immutable data structures is that, as the name implies, you can never mutate one, but only produce new versions of it. If you want to change an object's attribute, you'll need to make a new object with the new attribute, since you can't change the existing one. Because of the way persistent data structures work, this is actually much more efficient than it sounds.\r\n\r\n#### What this means in terms of change detection is that when a React component's state consists of immutable data only, there's an escape hatch: When you're re-rendering a component, and the component's state still points to the same data structure (Meaning nothing was changed, i.e. no new Object was created or Cloned because there was no change) as the last time you rendered it, you can skip re-rendering. You can just use the previous virtual DOM for that component and the whole component tree stemming from it. There's no need to dig in further, since nothing could possibly have changed in the state.\r\n\r\n### Pass by reference vs pass by value in pure JavaScript\r\n\r\n**To understand immutable data you need to understand that in JavaScript non-primitive types (objects, arrays, functions…) are passed by reference and primitive types (string, number, boolean, symbol, null and undefined) are passed by value. This means that primitive types are immutable by default and you can’t change them. Instead, when you pass a primitive type to another variable, it will get a new copy of that value. On the other hand non-primitive or compound data types, which are mutable.**\r\n\r\nLets see an example\r\n\r\nvar a = {};\r\nvar b = {};\r\n\r\na === b // false\r\n\r\nWhen you create new objects, arrays, functions, etc., a brand new object is placed into memory. Creating a new object with the same internals as another object will not magically cause that object to point to one that already exists. The objects may look the same, but they do not point to the same instance.\r\n\r\nNon-Primitive data-types like Objects are not compared by value. This means that even if two objects have the same properties and values, they are not strictly equal. Same goes for arrays. Even if they have the same elements that are in the same order, they are not strictly equal.\r\n\r\nNon primitive values can also be referred to as reference types because they are being compared by reference instead of value. Two objects are only strictly equal if they refer to the same underlying object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Primitive types are immutable by default\r\nlet x = 25;\r\nlet y = x;\r\ny = 100;\r\nconsole.log(x); // 25\r\nconsole.log(y); // 100\r\n\r\n// On the other hand, when you pass a variable of non-primitive type as an object to another variable, they will both point/refer to the same object.\r\n\r\n// Non-primitive types are mutable\r\nlet animal = {\r\n  name: \"Mouse\"\r\n};\r\n\r\nlet anotherAnimal = animal;\r\nanotherAnimal.name = \"Elephant\";\r\nconsole.log(animal); // {name: \"Elephant\"}\r\nconsole.log(anotherAnimal); // {name: \"Elephant\"}\r\nconsole.log(animal === anotherAnimal); // true\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### So, how should you handle immutable data in JavaScript?\r\n\r\n**MOST IMPORTANT POINT - When you want to update an object you should create a completely new object, thus keeping it immutable. For that purpose you can use the Object.assign method or object spread syntax:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst animal = { name: \"Mouse\" };\r\n// Object.assign\r\nconst anotherAnimal = Object.assign({}, animal, {\r\n  name: \"Elephant\"\r\n});\r\n// This method Object.assign() - has a flaw that it only does a shallow copy. It means that nested properties are still going to be copied by reference. Be careful about it.\r\n\r\n// Object spread operator\r\nconst yetAnotherAnimal = {\r\n  ...animal,\r\n  name: \"Crocodile\"\r\n};\r\nconsole.log(animal); // {name: \"Mouse\"}\r\nconsole.log(anotherAnimal); // {name: \"Elephant\"}\r\nconsole.log(yetAnotherAnimal); // {name: \"Crocodile\"}\r\nconsole.log(animal === anotherAnimal); // false\r\nconsole.log(animal === yetAnotherAnimal); // false\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with arrays you should not use methods that will mutate the given array such as push, shift, unshift, reverse,sort and other array methods. Instead, you should use their immutable equivalents. As you might have already noticed, in the beginning of every chapter I was using the spread operator instead of thepush method to add a new string into our devSkills array.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst animals = [\"Mouse\", \"Elephant\"];\r\nconst animalsUpgrade = [...animals, \"Crocodile\"];\r\nconsole.log(animals); // [\"Mouse\", \"Elephant\"]\r\nconsole.log(animalsUpgrade); // [\"Mouse\", \"Elephant\", \"Crocodile\"]\r\nconsole.log(animals === animalsUpgrade); // false\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy virtue of using immutability approach your state will become more predictable, your application more performant and your code more testable and debuggable\r\n\r\n#### [A great Explanation from Dan on 'Why cant state be mutated'](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/758)\r\n\r\n**While cloning the states after a state change - and remember state being an object so the principle (stated above) generally holds true that - When you want to update an object you should create a completely new object** - So this is what Dan had to say,\r\n\r\n**[Some can say](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/328)** this technique of creating a new state object on every change to the store would tax the gc and performance in a large application. But not much performance effect was seen. Dan has further clarified below on this topic -\r\n\r\n\"state is not deeply cloned on every action. Only the parts that changed are cloned (again, not deeply, depends on what changed). For example, when a todo is edited in TodoMVC app, only that todo object is cloned. The rest of the todo objects are the same. Of course, a root new todo list array is created, pointing to the new object, but the objects themselves are not cloned if they have not changed. Therefore it's not as expensive as it may seem. Furthermore, when it gets expensive (e.g. fast array changes), you can start using a library like Immutable.js that has very fast copying thanks to structural sharing. With Immutable.js, copying even large arrays isn't really that expensive because large chunks of the memory are reused. Finally, whether with or without Immutable.js, immutability helps us efficiently rerender the app because we know what exactly has changed thanks to the objects not being mutated.\"\r\n\r\n#### Why reducers need to be pure functions\r\n\r\n**Redux takes a given state (object) and passes it to each reducer in a loop. And it expects a brand new object from the reducer if there are any changes. And it also expects to get the old object back if there are no changes.**\r\n\r\n**Redux simply checks whether the old object is the same as the new object by comparing the memory locations of the two objects. Meaning if the memory-locations are different - its a change of State for Redux and re-rendering cycle is necessary, if memory-locations are same no change has occurred for Redux, so no re-rendering is required**\r\n\r\n**So if you mutate the old object’s property inside a reducer, the “new state” and the “old state” will both point to the same object.**\r\n\r\n**Because, in JavaScript non-primitive types (objects, arrays, functions…) are passed by reference. Hence Redux thinks nothing has changed! So this won’t work.**\r\n\r\n##### Further Reading\r\n\r\n- 1. https://medium.cobeisfresh.com/how-redux-can-make-you-a-better-developer-30a094d5e3ec\r\n- 2. https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-redux-needs-reducers-to-be-pure-functions-d438c58ae468\r\n"

NOT BY DEEP-COMPARING THE PROPS - So if you mutate the old object’s property inside a reducer, the “new state” and the “old state” will both point to the same object. Hence Redux thinks nothing has changed! So this won’t work.**\r\n\r\nBut, it still doesn’t answer some key questions like:\r\n\r\nWhy is Redux designed like this?\r\nWhy can’t Redux just make a copy of the old state some place else, then compare object props from reducers?\r\nWhy is Redux putting this burden on individual developers?\r\n\r\n#### The answer: there is only one way to know if two JavaScript objects have the same properties. To deep-compare them.\r\n\r\n#### But this becomes extremely expensive in real-world apps, because of the typically large objects and the number of times they need to be compared.\r\n\r\n#### So one work around is to have a policy to ask developers to create a new object whenever there is a change, then send it to the framework. And if there are no changes, then send back the old object as it is. In other words, new objects represent new states.\r\n\r\nNote that you must clone old states using slice — or a similar mechanism — to copy old values into a new object.\r\n\r\nNow, with this policy in place, you can compare two objects’ memory location using !== without having to compare each property within each object. And if the two objects are not the same, then you know that the object has changed state (that is, some property somewhere in the JavaScript object has changed). That’s exactly the strategy Redux employs to make things work.\r\n\r\nSo that’s why Redux needs for “Reducers” to be pure functions!\r\n\r\nPer [Redux Official Doc on Shallow Equality Checking](https://redux.js.org/faq/immutable-data#why-does-reduxs-use-of-shallow-equality-checking-require-immutability)\r\n\r\nWhy does Redux’s use of shallow equality checking require immutability?\r\nRedux's use of shallow equality checking requires immutability if any connected components are to be updated correctly. To see why, we need to understand the difference between shallow and deep equality checking in JavaScript.\r\n\r\nHow do shallow and deep equality checking differ?\r\nShallow equality checking (or reference equality) simply checks that two different variables reference the same object; in contrast, deep equality checking (or value equality) must check every value of two objects' properties.\r\n\r\nA shallow equality check is therefore as simple (and as fast) as a === b, whereas a deep equality check involves a recursive traversal through the properties of two objects, comparing the value of each property at each step.\r\n\r\nIt's for this improvement in performance that Redux uses shallow equality checking.\r\n\r\n#### However now a natural question is - Doesn't Redux mitigate deep comparisons with essentially deep cloning? Isn't it just moving the expensive operations to a different point in the lifecycle ?\r\n\r\n#### And the ans\r\n\r\n[https://redux.js.org/faq/immutable-data#how-does-redux-use-shallow-equality-checking](https://redux.js.org/faq/immutable-data#how-does-redux-use-shallow-equality-checking)\r\n\r\n**\"Redux uses shallow equality checking in its combineReducers function to return either a new mutated copy of the root state object, or, if no mutations have been made, the current root state object. combineReducers() function, iterates through each of these key/value pairs. At each stage of the iteration, combineReducers performs a shallow equality check on the current state slice and the state slice returned from the reducer.\"**\r\n\r\nTo update state immutability all the way down, a shallow copy at the level you're modifying and all its parent levels is all you need.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet state = {\r\n  a: {\r\n    a1: \"a1 initial value\",\r\n    a2: \"a2 initial value\"\r\n  },\r\n  b: {\r\n    b1: \"b1 initial value\",\r\n    b2: \"b2 initial value\"\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, if you just want to update a1? To do that, you need a copy of a and of state (because if you don't copy state itself, you're modifying the state tree it refers to, violating the immutability principal):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstate = { ...state, a: { ...obj.a, a1: \"updated a1\" } };\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n- [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-redux-needs-reducers-to-be-pure-functions-d438c58ae468/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-redux-needs-reducers-to-be-pure-functions-d438c58ae468/)\r\n- [https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/#summarizing-redux-s-technical-requirements](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/#summarizing-redux-s-technical-requirements)\r\n"

We import it as a name called styled. Then we can define what HTML element should be used for each styled-component. For example,\r\n\r\n``const Button = styled.button`` /* CSS Properties */ `\r\n\r\nmeans this Button component stands for the styled-component render a <button />. Then we can simply move the CSS properties to each styled-component. That’s it!\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from 'react'\r\nimport styled from 'styled-components'\r\n\r\nconst ContentWrapper = styled.div`\r\n  width: 80%;\r\n  height: 300px;\r\n  box-shadow: 0 0 5px 2px #ccc;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst Img = styled.div`\r\n  display: inline-block;\r\n  width: 300px;\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  background-image: url('https://picsum.photos/300/300?image=1062');\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst InfoWrapper = styled.div`\r\n  display: inline-block;\r\n  vertical-align: top;\r\n  width: calc(100% - 300px);\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst Title = styled.div`\r\n  padding: 20px 0 0 20px;\r\n  font-size: 48px;\r\n  color: ${props => (props.skyblue ? 'skyblue' : 'black')};\r\n`\r\n\r\nconst Description = styled.div`\r\n  padding: 20px;\r\n  font-size: 30px;\r\n  font-style: italic;\r\n  color: #888888;\r\n`\r\n\r\nexport default ({ skyblue }) => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <ContentWrapper>\r\n      <Img />\r\n      <InfoWrapper>\r\n        <Title skyblue>Cute Puppy</Title>\r\n        <Description>\r\n          Sed ut voluptatem neque cumque. Qui sed ut itaque est doloribus qui.\r\n          Eos perferendis autem qui fugiat.\r\n        </Description>\r\n      </InfoWrapper>\r\n    </ContentWrapper>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nWe pass the prop skyblue to the Title component which was built with styled-components. Then we can simply pass a function to the CSS properties we want to modify via template literals. As you can see, we pass an arrow function props => (props.skyblue ? 'skyblue' : 'black')to determine under what condition should Title’s color be sky blue, and we just finish changing Title’s color!\r\n\r\n### How About Debugging\r\n\r\nLet’s open Chrome Devtools to see what happens when we build a component with styled-components.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"styled-component-dev-tool.jpeg\">\r\n\r\nStyled-components have a built-in CSS module system. This is great for solving the problem of classnames conflict. However, we definitely don’t know what classes are we using when we try to debug on Chrome Devtools. Do you know what HTML element we are using? absolutely not, right? You have to look back at each styled-component to check what HTML element is it using."

You are no longer styling HTML elements or components based on their class or HTML element:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<h1 className=\"title\">Hello World</h1>\r\nh1.title{\r\n  font-size: 1.5em;\r\n  color: purple;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nInstead, you’re defining styled components that possesses their own encapsulated styles. Then you’re using these freely throughout your codebase: In the below <Title /> is a styled-component\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport styled from 'styled-components';\r\n\r\nconst Title = styled.h1`\r\n  font-size: 1.5em;\r\n  color: purple;\r\n`;\r\n<Title>Hello World</Title>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis might seem like a minor difference, and in fact both syntaxes are very similar. But they key difference is that styles are now part of their component.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we’re getting rid of CSS classes as an intermediary step between the component and its styles. As styled-components co-creator Max Stoiber says:\r\n\r\n“The basic idea of styled-components is to enforce best practices by removing the mapping between styles and components.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Another example - say in a file called Landing.js Component in which the <Wrapper /> is a styled-component\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport styled from 'styled-components';\r\n\r\n\r\n<Wrapper>\r\n        <ImgLogo src={require(\"../Images/logo.png\")} />\r\n</Wrapper>\r\n\r\nconst Wrapper = styled.div`\r\n    background: #ffffff;\r\n    height: 80px;\r\n    position: relative;\r\n    top: 50%;\r\n    -webkit-transform: translateY(-50%);\r\n    -ms-transform: translateY(-50%);\r\n    transform: translateY(-50%);\r\n`;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Props Over Classes\r\n\r\nIn keeping with this no-classes philosophy, styled-components makes use of props over classes when it comes to customizing the behavior of a component. So instead of:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<h1 className=\"title primary\">Hello World</h1> // will be blue\r\nh1.title{\r\n  font-size: 1.5em;\r\n  color: purple;\r\n\r\n  &.primary{\r\n    color: blue;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou’d write the below Title styled-component\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Title = styled.h1`\r\n  font-size: 1.5em;\r\n  color: ${props => props.primary ? 'blue' : 'purple'};\r\n`;\r\n\r\n<Title primary>Hello World</Title> // will be blue\r\n```"

This takes a snapshot of your component and how it renders and then will compare that whenever doing other tests to let you know if something unexpected is happening.\r\n\r\n A snapshot test is essentially what the name implies. Jest takes the component that it is testing, renders it, and then takes a snapshot of what the component should look like. When continuing to work on your project, every time you run your test suite, Jest will do the process over again and compare the old snapshot to a new one. If the snapshots do not match, then they an error message shows in the terminal and highlights the parts that do not match.\r\n\r\n A typical snapshot test case for a mobile app renders a UI component, takes a screenshot, then compares it to a reference image stored alongside the test. The test will fail if the two images do not match: either the change is unexpected, or the screenshot needs to be updated to the new version of the UI component.\r\n\r\nSnapshot testing while very useful is not considered TDD. Snapshot testing requires a component to be written already so it can take a picture of it. Snapshot testing also relies on the fact that your component renders correctly already. TDD requires that you write tests for your component that originally fail, and as you code the component, it passes the tests. So while snapshot testing is not TDD, it can still be a useful tool for keeping track of your components and making sure they do not change unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n[From Jest Official Guide](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tomatchsnapshotpropertymatchers-snapshotname)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Good Guides to refer\r\n\r\n[Official Guide from Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing)\r\n\r\nhttps://hackernoon.com/snapshot-testing-react-components-with-jest-744a1e980366\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.kentcdodds.com/effective-snapshot-testing-e0d1a2c28eca"

Shallow rendering lets you render a component “one level deep” and assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered. This does not require a DOM.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have the following component:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction MyComponent() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <span className=\"heading\">Title</span>\r\n      <Subcomponent foo=\"bar\" />\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen you can assert:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport ShallowRenderer from 'react-test-renderer/shallow';\r\n\r\n// in your test:\r\nconst renderer = new ShallowRenderer();\r\nrenderer.render(<MyComponent />);\r\nconst result = renderer.getRenderOutput();\r\n\r\nexpect(result.type).toBe('div');\r\nexpect(result.props.children).toEqual([\r\n  <span className=\"heading\">Title</span>,\r\n  <Subcomponent foo=\"bar\" />\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut remember that this **shallow** is different from enzyme's **shallow**\r\n\r\nSome in the developer community opine that - use Enzyme's shallow and enzyme-to-json for your Jest snapshot tests (instead of react-test-renderer). Why? Because **Enzyme's shallow** creates snapshots that omit child components, so each snapshot is truly tied to a single component.\r\n\r\nShallow rendering is useful to constrain yourself to testing a component as a unit, and to ensure that your tests aren't indirectly asserting on behavior of child components"

It’s really just an equivalent of this all-too-familiar snippet of JavaScript:\r\n\r\n`document.getElementById('foo-id');`\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what React.createRef() does, although it requires a bit of a different setup.\r\n\r\n### refs are used to get reference to a DOM node or an instance of a component in a React Application i.e. refs would return the node we are referencing .\r\n\r\nSimilarly to keys refs are added to elements in the form of attributes. According to React.js documentation some of the best cases for using refs are: managing focus, text selection, or media playback, triggering animations, and integrating with third-party DOM libraries.\r\n\r\nIn the typical React dataflow, props are the only way that parent components interact with their children. To modify a child, you re-render it with new props. However, there are a few cases where you need to imperatively modify a child outside of the typical dataflow. In other words, in some cases you might need to modify a child without re-rendering it with new props. That’s exactly when refs attribute comes to use.\r\nThe child to be modified could be an instance of a React component, or it could be a DOM element. For both of these cases, React provides an escape hatch.\r\n\r\n[https://alligator.io/react/createref/](https://alligator.io/react/createref/)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Foobar extends Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.myInput = React.createRef();    // initialize \"this.myInput\"\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <input ref={this.myInput}/>        {/* pass \"this.myInput\" as prop */}\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### All standard HTML elements in React have a reserved prop called ref (much like style which is a reserved prop). Simply pass the ref you initialized in the constructor to the ref prop… and voila! You can start interacting with the <input> DOM node by using this.myInput.current\r\n\r\n`this.myInput.current` holds the reference to the DOM node\r\n\r\nExample: Focusing an <input>\r\nTaking that last code snippet, let’s make the most common use-case of createRef() to demonstrate how we could start interacting with the <input> DOM node:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default class App extends Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props)\r\n    this.myInput = React.createRef()\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <input ref={this.myInput} />\r\n\r\n        <button\r\n          onClick={() => {\r\n            this.myInput.current.focus()\r\n          }}\r\n        >\r\n          focus!\r\n        </button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### The API is very simple. You first define a ref, assign it to the element you want to manipulate and call focus on ref’s current property.\r\n\r\nCalling the focus() method isn’t a React.js thing… it’s a normal JavaScript thing! 💃🏻💃🏻 For example, this is how it’s done with vanilla JavaScript:\r\n\r\n`document.getElementById('myInput').focus();`\r\n\r\nNow, this is how to achieve the same example above using callback refs:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass SimpleCallbackRef extends Component {\r\n  onClick() {\r\n    this.inputRef.focus()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <input\r\n          ref={ref => {\r\n            this.inputRef = ref\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n        <button onClick={this.onClick.bind(this)}>Click to Focus</button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that although you don’t need to manually create a ref anymore, the callback function ref => { this.inputRef = ref; } looks less natural.\r\n\r\n### Refs with React Hooks Using useRef\r\n\r\nRefs in React Hooks aren’t much different than class components. It’s achieved using the useRef hook. Just remember to omit this and you are golden\r\n\r\n```JS\r\nfunction App() {\r\n\r\n  const myInput = useRef(null);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input ref={myInput}/>\r\n      <button onClick={() => {\r\n        myInput.current.focus();\r\n      }}>\r\n        focus!\r\n      </button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Multiple APIs\r\n\r\nWhen refs were first born, the React team encouraged the use of string refs. This is no longer the case as this API will be deprecated. A powerful alternative was introduced: callback refs. But all this power came with a price – callback refs are more verbose and may behave oddly. In order to simplify things, the createRef API came into play. And finally, after Hooks were introduced, useRef emerged. But, because there are four ways of doing the same thing, people started losing faith in refs. Let’s fix this.\r\n\r\n#### should we use callback refs or the createRef API?\r\n\r\nThe short answer is that most of the time you can safely use the createRef API. Although you can always achieve the same result using callback refs, recall that this new API was specially crafted in order to simplify your experience. You can look at its RFC in order to understand the React team’s motivations behind it. In short, the goal was to maintain the simplicity of the deprecated string refs and purposely keep a simple API, leaving callback refs for more complex use cases.\r\n\r\n**Note, You can't use createRef for pure functional components since they lack many of the React-y features like state & lifecycle components**\r\n\r\n#### Finally, as a rule of thumb:\r\n\r\n- Don’t overuse refs\r\n- Abolish string refs\r\n- Use callback refs when you have to dynamically set them\r\n- When in a class component, use createRef in all other cases\r\n- When in a function component, use useRef in all other cases\r\n- Use forwardRef when you need access to a child ref\r\n- Use Hooks to empower your function component\r\n- If the child ref must not be a function component, then use a custom method to trigger focus programmatically from the parent (remember you will get a component instance, not a DOM element)\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://moduscreate.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-refs-in-react/](https://moduscreate.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-refs-in-react/)\r\n\r\n[All refs in one place](https://react-refs-cheatsheet.netlify.com/)\r\n"

            "content": "## Keys\r\n\r\nKeys React are utilised to identify specific Virtual DOM Elements that have changed. The classic example of usage of keys is a list. Let’s imagine we have an array of objects:\r\n\r\n``fruits = [{name: \"Pineapple\", id: 1}, {name: \"Banana\", id: 2}, {name: \"Passion Fruit\", id: 3}``\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we were to pass this array as a prop to a FruitList component in order to render a list of fruits onto the page, we would iterate through our array of fruits, rendering each one as a list item:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst FruitList = (props) => {\r\n    const fruits = props.fruits.map(fruit =>\r\n    <li>{fruit.name}</li>\r\n   )\r\n   return (\r\n       <ul>\r\n        {fruits}\r\n       </ul>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works and does indeed render the list of fruits. However at any moment we might want to add new fruits, as well as delete or modify the existing ones. How would React know to perform those changes efficiently? That’s where the key attribute comes in handy. There are usually several choices for creating element’s unique identity. One of them is using existing IDs of each object:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst FruitList = (props) => {\r\n    const fruits = props.fruits.map(fruit =>\r\n    <li key={fruit.id}>{fruit.name}</li>\r\n   )\r\n   return (\r\n       <ul>\r\n        {fruits}\r\n       </ul>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou might also find yourself in a situation when items in your array don’t really possess a unique ID. In case of no stable IDs for rendered items, index of iterator may be used as a key.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst FruitList = (props) => {\r\n    const fruits = props.fruits.map((fruit, index) =>\r\n    <li key={index.id}>{fruit.name}</li>\r\n   )\r\n   return (\r\n       <ul>\r\n        {fruits}\r\n       </ul>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### An important note for key usage is that they only have to be unique among their siblings. Keys don’t have to be globally unique, meaning that the same keys can be used for two different arrays.\r\n\r\n## When you need refs instead of ID’s ?\r\n\r\nAs we all know , ID’s works on a single element in whole DOM tree thus lets say we want to change the background-color on focus . With ID’s this will happen but only the first input box will get the red color\r\n\r\n<img src=\"refs-in-react.png\">\r\n\r\nAs Bob comes before Tim and both have the same ID on which background manipulation code runs but only Bob gets angry on focus not Tim. If we use refs we can replace the IDs with the a particular ref name and we should be doing fine. But i would suggest using classes for use-case of this kind as its much better and also refs has its caveats which we would see soon."

            "content": "#### What is useRef()\r\n\r\n[By React Official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#is-there-something-like-instance-variables)\r\n\r\nYes! The useRef() Hook isn’t just for DOM refs. The “ref” object is a generic container whose current property is mutable and can hold any value, similar to an instance property on a class.\r\n\r\n**useRef** can be used to store and arbitrary value. E.g. you might want to use `useRef` to keep a mutable value for the entire life of the component. You can think of it as useState (in terms of hooks) but it doesn’t trigger a re-render. It’s similar to instance fields (e.g. this.timeoutId) in class components.\r\n\r\nYou can write to it from inside useEffect:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction Timer() {\r\n  const intervalRef = useRef();\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const id = setInterval(() => {\r\n      // ...\r\n    });\r\n    intervalRef.current = id;\r\n\r\n    return () => {\r\n      clearInterval(intervalRef.current);\r\n    };\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we just wanted to set an interval, we wouldn’t need the ref (id could be local to the effect), but it’s useful if we want to clear the interval from an event handler\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction handleCancelClick() {\r\n  clearInterval(intervalRef.current);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Example use case in a DOM based situation\r\n\r\nIn react useRef hooks helps us to access the dom nodes or elements so that we can interact with that dom element like accessing the input element value or focussing the input element.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { useRef } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction TextInput() {\r\n  //creating the ref by passing initial value null\r\n  const nameRef = useRef(null);\r\n\r\n  function handleFocus() {\r\n    //current is pointing to input element when component is mounts to dom\r\n    nameRef.current.focus();\r\n  }\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input ref={nameRef} placeholder=\"name\" />\r\n      <button onClick={handleFocus}>Focus</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example we have imported useRef hook from the `react` then we invoked the useRef hooks by passing the initial value null.\r\n\r\nIn input element we defined **ref** attribute by passing the nameRef so that we can access the input element in nameRef.current property.\r\n\r\n##### First Explanation -\r\n\r\nIn plain JavaScript you had to use **getElementById** or **querySelector** to select a DOM node.\r\n\r\nBut this is not an ideal solution in React.\r\n\r\nIn React you want to use the useRef hook or if you’re in a React class component, you want to use createRef.\r\n\r\nThe reason you don’t want to use **getElementById** or **querySelector** is because you may be designing your React app to output multiple of the same ID’s, which is a no no.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to use useRef is because it helps with the unidirectional (single direction) data flow.\r\n\r\nYou can define a node reference in a parent component and toss them down to child components.\r\n\r\nHence the single direction data flow.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Old reference method\r\nconst inputRef = document.querySelector('input')\r\n\r\n// React hooks way\r\nconst inputRef = useRef()\r\n\r\n<input ref={inputRef}>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nReact will than give you a an object with a property called current.\r\n\r\nPer official doc - useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.\r\n\r\nThe value of current is an object that represents the DOM node you’ve selected to reference.\r\n\r\nYou should avoid using reference calls as much as possible. There are only 3 good reasons why you’d need to use the useRef hook.\r\n\r\nManaging focus, text selection, or media playback\r\nTriggering imperative animations\r\nIntegrating with third-party DOM libraries\r\n\r\nRefs are used to access DOM or React elements rendered in the render function. And the standard way of using refs in previous React versions was something like this\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.myRef = React.createRef();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <div ref={this.myRef} />;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd to have access to the current node -\r\n\r\n`const node = this.myRef.current;`\r\n\r\nNow with new hooks api **useRef**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { useRef } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction UnderstandRefHooks() {\r\n  // create refs\r\n  const inputRef = useRef();\r\n\r\n  const handleChange = () => {\r\n    console.log(inputRef.current);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input onChange={handleChange} ref={inputRef} />\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Second Explanation -\r\n\r\nThe useRef hook is pretty powerful and often can be abused. In general, developers should avoid using useRef if they could use useState instead.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { useEffect, useRef } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nconst GoodCounter = () => {\r\n  const count = useRef(0);\r\n  let currentCount = count.current;\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    count.current = currentCount;\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  currentCount += 1;\r\n\r\n  return <div>count:{currentCount}</div>;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default GoodCounter;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code uses useEffect, whose first argument function is only invoked in the commit phase. The currentCount is a local variable within the render function scope, and it will only change the ref count in the commit phase. The ref is essentially a global variable outside the function scope, hence modifying it is a side effect.\r\n\r\nBy Dan himself - **useRef() is basically useState({current: initialValue })[0]**\r\n\r\n##### Third Explanation -\r\n\r\n[https://www.codebeast.dev/usestate-vs-useref-re-render-or-not/](https://www.codebeast.dev/usestate-vs-useref-re-render-or-not/)\r\n\r\n- useState causes re-render; useRef does not.\r\n- Both useState and useRef remembers their data after a re-render\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n- 1.

        "content": "#### One simple use case for implementing this React context API\r\n\r\nHave you ever experienced the pain of trying to get state from the top of your react tree to the bottom? This pain you’re feeling is called “prop drilling” and it’s super annoying. You wind up having to pass props through components that don’t care about the data just so you can send it down to components that do care. And as you move components around this pain is magnified.\r\n\r\nYou could actually use a regular JavaScript module to avoid these problems. Just put the data in a singleton module and poof, it’s accessible/importable anywhere. But then you have trouble with updates (you have to implement an event emitter to notify subscribers when there are updates), and server side rendering can be problematic with singletons as well.\r\n\r\nSo this is where state management libraries like redux come into play (specifically react-redux). They allow you to get data from the store easily anywhere in the tree. All you have to do is use this thing called a <Provider /> and magically your store data is accessible by any component that is \"connected.\"\r\n\r\nSo the provider component puts the data into context, and the connect Higher Order Component pulls the data out of context. So in reality, redux isn't allowing your data to be accessible anywhere... context is!\r\n\r\n#### Another simple use case for implementing this React context API\r\n\r\nMost apps need a way to unobtrusively display notifications to users as they happen. Suppose you’re running a 20% off sale and you’d like to let your users know as soon as they sign in, or maybe after they submit feedback you want to display a thank you message.\r\n\r\nMaterial UI provides a snackbar component which is great for these types of messages, so I’ll be using that for this example. That being said, this article is much more about the Context API than Material UI, and swapping out Material UI for any other component library would be very simple with this approach.\r\n\r\nMany apps need to trigger messages from dozens of different components. The React Context API makes it dead simple to provide all components access to a shared snackbar so they can trigger these messages without needing to implement separate components for each message.\r\n\r\n### [How Do I Use Context?](https://hackernoon.com/how-do-i-use-react-context-3eeb879169a2)\r\n\r\n[the codesandbox for this code](https://codesandbox.io/s/04l03y3q9v)\r\n\r\nProp Drilling\r\nI’ve built an application that stores a family’s last name in a <Grandmother /> component. The <Child /> component than displays the last name.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst App = () => <Grandmother />\r\n\r\nclass Grandmother extends React.Component {\r\n  state = {\r\n    lastName: \"Sanchez\",\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <Mother lastName={this.state.lastName} />\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst Mother = ({ lastName }) => {\r\n  return <Child lastName={lastName} />\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst Child = ({ lastName }) => {\r\n  return <p>{lastName}</p>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nWe can refactor this example to use Context instead. Using Context means we don’t need to pass the lastName through the <Mother /> component. We circumvent components that don’t need to know the lastName property, and share that state only with components that need to know it.\r\n\r\nFirst, we will need to create our Context in a separate file, say **FamilyContext.js**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\"\r\n\r\nconst FamilyContext = React.createContext({})\r\n\r\nexport const FamilyProvider = FamilyContext.Provider\r\nexport const FamilyConsumer = FamilyContext.Consumer\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use`createContext()` and pass it an empty object as the default value:\r\n\r\n`const FamilyContext = React.createContext({});`\r\n\r\nWe then create a Provider and a Consumer component and export them so they are available for consumption by other components in your application.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const FamilyProvider = FamilyContext.Provider\r\nexport const FamilyConsumer = FamilyContext.Consumer\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere’s the final and full code of how we will use the Provider and Consumer in the Grandmother.js file\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\"\r\nimport { FamilyProvider, FamilyConsumer } from \"./FamilyContext\"\r\n\r\nexport class Grandmother extends React.Component {\r\n  state = {\r\n    lastName: \"Sanchez\",\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      // We wrap all of the components that need access\r\n      // to the lastName property in FamilyProvider.\r\n      <FamilyProvider value={this.state.lastName}>\r\n        <Mother />\r\n      </FamilyProvider>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst Mother = () => {\r\n  return <Child />\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst Child = () => {\r\n  // We wrap the component that actaully needs access to\r\n  // the lastName property in FamilyConsumer\r\n  return <FamilyConsumer>{(context) => <p>{context}</p>}</FamilyConsumer>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, we have wrapped the <Mother /> component with <FamilyProvider /> because it contains <Child /> which is the component that needs access to the lastName prop.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<FamilyProvider value={this.state.lastName}>\r\n  <Mother />\r\n</FamilyProvider>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that the Provider has a value prop. Pass in whatever state you’d like to share. In our case, we want to share the lastName so we pass in this.state.lastName.\r\n\r\nTo actually have access to the lastName, we have also wrapped the <p> tag on line 27 in the <FamilyConsumer /> component so that it has access to the context.\r\n\r\n### Let’s dig a bit deeper into <FamilyConsumer />!\r\n\r\nAt first, it might look a bit confusing if you aren’t familiar with the **[render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html)** pattern, but with a bit of explanation I think you might find that it’s a fairly straightforward implementation. You don’t need to know how to build a render prop to use Context, but it’s a really powerful abstraction!\r\n\r\n### What’s a Render Prop?\r\n\r\nThe term **“render prop”** refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.\r\n\r\nA **render prop** is a way of writing components in React so that they are reusable, and can take n number of children of any type. Render props appear in a couple of different disguises. Context implements a Function as a Child Pattern, which is just a render prop called children.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Child = () => {\r\n  // Family Consumer uses the\r\n  // Function as a Child pattern\r\n  return (\r\n    <FamilyConsumer>\r\n      // context is the object with lastName // on it. It gets passed as an\r\n      argument\r\n      {(context) => <p>{context}</p>}\r\n    </FamilyConsumer>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<FamilyConsumer /> uses a render prop to expose the context object to its children (in this case a <p /> tag but it could be anything).\r\n\r\nUltimately, Context is a great tool to add to your React toolbox. Use it when you find prop drilling has become too complex, but your application isn’t large enough to warrant a third-party solution like MobX or redux.\r\n\r\n### When Should I Use Context?\r\n\r\n[https://hackernoon.com/how-do-i-use-react-context-3eeb879169a2](https://hackernoon.com/how-do-i-use-react-context-3eeb879169a2)\r\nI would recommend reaching for Context when you find yourself passing props down through three or more levels in your component tree. You might notice that you have renamed your props, making it challenging to determine the data’s origin. You might consider implementing context if a bunch of your components know about irrelevant data.\r\n\r\n#### More References\r\n\r\n1> [https://medium.com/dailyjs/reacts-%EF%B8%8F-new-context-api-70c9fe01596b](https://medium.com/dailyjs/reacts-%EF%B8%8F-new-context-api-70c9fe01596b)\r\n\r\n2>\r\n"

        "content": "### What is the difference between a controlled component and an uncontrolled component?\r\n\r\nA large part of React is this idea of having components control and manage their own state. What happens when we throw native HTML form elements (input, select, textarea, etc) into the mix? Should we have React be the “single source of truth” like we’re used to doing with React or should we allow that form data to live in the DOM like we’re used to typically doing with HTML form elements? These two questions are at the heart of controlled vs uncontrolled components.\r\n\r\nA controlled component is a component where React is in control and is the single source of truth for the form data. As you can see below, username doesn’t live in the DOM but instead lives in our component state. Whenever we want to update username, we call setState as we’re used to.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass ControlledForm extends Component {\r\n  state = {\r\n    username: ''\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  updateUsername = (e) => {\r\n    this.setState({\r\n      username: e.target.value,\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  handleSubmit = () => {}\r\n\r\n  render () {\r\n    return (\r\n      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\r\n        <input\r\n          type='text'\r\n          value={this.state.username}\r\n          onChange={this.updateUsername} />\r\n        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>\r\n      </form>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A user types into the input box → onChange is triggered invoking the updateUsername function. → the state of our component is set to a new value → React re-renders the virtual DOM → React Diffs the change → Real DOM is updated.\r\n\r\nAn uncontrolled component is where your form data is handled by the DOM, instead of inside your React component.\r\n\r\nYou use refs to accomplish this.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass UnControlledForm extends Component {\r\n\r\n  handleSubmit = () => {\r\n    console.log(\"Input Value: \", this.input.value)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render () {\r\n    return (\r\n      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\r\n        <input\r\n          type='text'\r\n          ref={(input) => this.input = input} />\r\n        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>\r\n      </form>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough uncontrolled components are typically easier to implement since you just grab the value from the DOM using refs, it’s typically recommended that you favor controlled components over uncontrolled components. The main reasons for this are that controlled components support instant field validation, allow you to conditionally disable/enable buttons, enforce input formats, and are more “the React way”."

Fortunately, there is a shorthand syntax for getting rid of both annoyances:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Counter extends Component {\r\n  state = {\r\n    counter: 0,\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  onIncrement = () => {\r\n    this.setState(state => ({ counter: state.counter + 1 }));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  onDecrement = () => {\r\n    this.setState(state => ({ counter: state.counter - 1 }));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <p>{this.state.counter}</p>\r\n\r\n        <button onClick={this.onIncrement} type=\"button\">Increment</button>\r\n        <button onClick={this.onDecrement} type=\"button\">Decrement</button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy using JavaScript arrow functions, you can auto-bind class methods without having to bind them in the constructor. Because arrow function does not ``this`` have its own this, and it will bind to the this of surrounding context.\r\n\r\nAlso the constructor can be left out, when not using the props, by defining the state directly as a class property. (Note: Be aware that class properties are not in the JavaScript language yet.) Therefore you can say that this way of defining a React class component is way more concise than the other version."

        "content": "### Basics application of Destructuring\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout using the destructuring syntax getting multiple values out of an array can be quite cumbersome. You would do something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst items = ['car', 'bike', 'plane'];\r\n\r\nconst car = items[0];\r\nconst bike = items[1];\r\nconst plane = items[2];\r\n\r\nconsole.log(car); // 'car'\r\nconsole.log(bike); // 'bike'\r\nconsole.log(plane); // 'plane'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the destructuring assignment syntax this can be written like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst items = ['car', 'bike', 'plane'];\r\nconst [car, bike, plane] = items;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(car); // 'car'\r\nconsole.log(bike); // 'bike'\r\nconsole.log(plane); // 'plane'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax also works with nested arrays:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst items = ['car', ['bike', 'plane'], ['boat']];\r\nconst [car, [bike, plane], [boat]] = items;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(car); // 'car'\r\nconsole.log(bike); // 'bike'\r\nconsole.log(plane); // 'plane'\r\nconsole.log(boat); // 'boat'\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can combine the destructuring syntax with the rest syntax:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst items = ['car', 'bike', 'plane', 'boat'];\r\nconst [car, ...transportation] = items;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(car); // 'car'\r\nconsole.log(transportation); // ['bike', 'plane', 'boat']\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The destructuring assignment syntax with Objects\r\n\r\n\r\nDestructuring with Objects helps you assigning property values to variables. I only specify the binded property, and this will be bound to the value to of the property. \r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nconst car = {\r\n  brand: 'ferrari',\r\n  type: 'sportscar',\r\n  horsepower: 600,\r\n  wheels: 4\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst { brand, type } = car;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(brand); // ferrari\r\nconsole.log(type); // sportscar\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust like with Arrays you can also use this syntax with nested objects:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst car = {\r\n  brand: 'ferrari',\r\n  type: 'sportscar',\r\n  engine: { \r\n    horsepower: 600,\r\n    liters: 4,\r\n    fuel: 'gas'\r\n  },\r\n  wheels: 4\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst { engine: { horsepower } } = car;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(horsepower); // 600\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Aplication of destructuring\r\n\r\nThe destructuring syntax can help when accepting parameters in functions. Instead of requesting specific arguments in a specific order it would be a lot easier to just pass one object and then expose only the needed properties using the destructuring syntax:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst carFunction = ({ brand, engine: { horsepower, liters }}) => {\r\n  return `${brand} with engine of ${horsepower} horsepower and ${liters} liters`\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst car = {\r\n  brand: 'ferrari',\r\n  type: 'sportscar',\r\n  engine: {\r\n    horsepower: 600,\r\n    liters: 4,\r\n    fuel: 'gas'\r\n  },\r\n  wheels: 4\r\n};\r\n\r\nconsole.log(carFunction(car)); // ferrari with engine of 600 horsepower and 4 liters\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nLast but not least the destructuring syntax is very helpful when importing from CommonJS modules. Most likely the module exports more than you need and with this syntax you can avoid cluttering the namespace.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { session } = require('passport');\r\nsession();\r\n\r\n// instead of\r\nconst passport = require('passport');\r\npassport.session();\r\n```"

        "content": "## Destructuring in React is useful for both functional and class components but is achieved just a tad bit differently.\r\n\r\n### As a general rule use ``const`` instead of ``let`` while destructuring props. Props are not allowed to be mutated. Using ``const`` would prevent reassigning variables which goes against immutable data concepts a little I think? If the variable won’t be reassigned, it should really just be const as that’s its purpose.\r\n\r\nLet’s consider a parent component called **Properties** in our application:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass Properties extends Component {\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    super();\r\n\r\n    this.properties = [\r\n      {\r\n        title: 'Modern Loft',\r\n        type: 'Studio',\r\n        location: {\r\n          city: 'San Francisco',\r\n          state: 'CA',\r\n          country: 'USA'\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        title: 'Spacious 2 Bedroom',\r\n        type: 'Condo',\r\n        location: {\r\n          city: 'Los Angeles',\r\n          state: 'CA',\r\n          country: 'USA'\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n    ];\r\n  }\r\n\r\nrender() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <Listing listing={this.properties[0]} />\r\n        <Listing listing={this.properties[1]} />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Functional Child Component implementation passing down the props from above parent ``Properties`` component to child ``Listing`` component\r\n## That is the case, when ``Listing`` is a pure functional component as a child of ``Properties`` component\r\n\r\nIn this example, we want to pass down a **listing** object from our array of properties for the child component named **Listing** to render.\r\n\r\nHere’s how a functional component would look without destructuring :\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst Listing = (props) => (\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>Title: {props.listing.title}</p>\r\n    <p>Type: {props.listing.type}</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Location: {props.listing.location.city},\r\n      {props.listing.location.state},\r\n      {props.listing.location.country}\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis block of code is fully functional but looks terrible! By the time we get to this ``Listing`` child component, we already know we’re referencing to a ``listing`` prop, so ``props.listing`` looks and feels redundant. This block of code can be made to look much cleaner through destructuring.\r\n\r\nWe can achieve this in the function parameter as we pass in the props argument:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Listing = ({ listing }) => (\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>Title: {listing.title}</p>\r\n    <p>Type: {listing.type}</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Location: {listing.location.city},\r\n      {listing.location.state},\r\n      {listing.location.country}\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n**The reason for ({ listing }) i.e. wrapping ``listing`` in a parentheis** -   I am passing the ``listing`` prop which is an object (being extracted from the Parent compoenet Property's ``properties`` array) -  And when returning an Object, I will have to wrap it in parentheses. Hence the parenthesis before the curly braces. Just like in a ``mapStateToProps`` function.\r\n\r\nEven better, we can further destructure nested objects like below:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Listing = ({\r\n  listing: {\r\n    title,\r\n    type,\r\n    location: {\r\n      city,\r\n      state,\r\n      country\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}) => (\r\n  <div>\r\n    <p>Title: {title}</p>\r\n    <p>Type: {type}</p>\r\n    <p>Location: {city}, {state}, {country}</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan you see how much easier this is to read? In this example, we’ve destructured both listings and the keys inside listing.\r\n\r\n## Class Child Component implementation passing down the props from above parent ``Properties`` component to child ``Listing`` component\r\n## That is the case, when ``Listing`` is a class component as a child of ``Properties`` component\r\n\r\nThe idea is very much the same in class components, only here, I have to use render() and return() syntax while declaring the de-structured ``listing`` prop inside the ``render()``. Also, I can destructure the Component object as I import React in class components. This isn’t necessary for functional components as we won’t be extending the Component class for those.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass Listing extends Component {\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n\r\n    const {\r\n      listing: {\r\n        title,\r\n        type,\r\n        location: {\r\n          city,\r\n          state,\r\n          country\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    } = this.props;\r\n\r\nreturn (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <p>Title: {title}</p>\r\n        <p>Type: {type}</p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Location: {city}, {state}, {country}\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Differences with Functional Component** - Instead of destructuring in the argument ( like I did in the functional ), I destructure wherever the variables are being called. For example, here in ``Listing`` child component I destructured in the ``render()`` function where the props are being referenced.\r\n\r\n"

Very simply its passing an object as an argument to the function, but the destructuring uses only the named properties of the object.**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst destructuring = ({ used }) => console.log(used);\r\n\r\nconst properties = {\r\n  unused: 1,\r\n  used: 2,\r\n};\r\n\r\ndestructuring(properties); // => 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Another example of just saving me 4 characters while writing codes\r\n\r\nsay I have the below state\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstate = {\r\n    items: [\r\n    { value: 'Pants', id: uniqueId(), packed: false },\r\n    { value: 'Jacket', id: uniqueId(), packed: false },\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now I have to render the state.items - so for that I have to do ``this.state.items`` - BUT with destructuring I can do the below inside render()\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrender() {\r\n    const { items } = this.state;\r\n    return (\r\n        // codes\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it saved me just 4 characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Benefits of destructuring - Shorter code\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar object = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }\r\n\r\nlet one = object.one;\r\nlet two = object.two;\r\nlet three = object.three;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(one, two, three) // prints 1, 2, 3\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Now with destructuring, the same code becomes much more clear and shorter\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar object = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }\r\n\r\nlet { once, tow, three } = object\r\n\r\nconsole.log(one, two, three) // prints 1, 2, 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Benefits of destructuring - Better readable code\r\n\r\nLarge components often suffer from this.props syndrome. That is to say, you see the phrase this.props all over the place, which unfortunately detracts from readability by acting as a source of extra noise. Take this example of a Product Price component which has a lot of props to render:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrender() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <ProductPrice\r\n      hidePriceFulfillmentDisplay=\r\n       {this.props.hidePriceFulfillmentDisplay}\r\n      primaryOffer={this.props.primaryOffer}\r\n      productType={this.props.productType}\r\n      productPageUrl={this.props.productPageUrl}\r\n      inventory={this.props.inventory}\r\n      submapType={this.props.submapType}\r\n      ppu={this.props.ppu}\r\n      isLoggedIn={this.props.isLoggedIn}\r\n      gridView={this.props.isGridView}\r\n    />\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nAfter cutting down all these ``this.props`` noise. The below is much easier to read and clearly points out which props we are using in the component.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrender() {\r\n  const {\r\n    hidePriceFulfillmentDisplay,\r\n    primaryOffer,\r\n    productType,\r\n    productPageUrl,\r\n    inventory,\r\n    submapType,\r\n    ppu,\r\n    isLoggedIn,\r\n    gridView\r\n  } = this.props;\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <ProductPrice\r\n      hidePriceFulfillmentDisplay={hidePriceFulfillmentDisplay}\r\n      primaryOffer={primaryOffer}\r\n      productType={productType}\r\n      productPageUrl={productPageUrl}\r\n      inventory={inventory}\r\n      submapType={submapType}\r\n      ppu={ppu}\r\n      isLoggedIn={isLoggedIn}\r\n      gridView={isGridView}\r\n    />\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes sense to do in a large component where the same props might be used multiple times and in several subcomponents, but in this simple example we can use Spread Attributes for a super shortcut:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrender() {\r\n    const props = this.props;\r\n    return ( <ProductPrice {...props} /> )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStateless Functional Components (as mentioned earlier) make great use of Object Destructuring, since they receive props as an arg:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst ProductPrice = ({\r\n  hidePriceFulfillmentDisplay,\r\n  primaryOffer,\r\n  productType,\r\n  productPageUrl,\r\n  inventory,\r\n  submapType,\r\n  ppu,\r\n  isLoggedIn,\r\n  gridView\r\n}) =>\r\n  <ProductPrice\r\n    hidePriceFulfillmentDisplay={hidePriceFulfillmentDisplay}\r\n    primaryOffer={primaryOffer}\r\n    productType={productType}\r\n    productPageUrl={productPageUrl}\r\n    inventory={inventory}\r\n    submapType={submapType}\r\n    ppu={ppu}\r\n    isLoggedIn={isLoggedIn}\r\n    gridView={isGridView}\r\n  />\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n"

It’s often the case that you have to access plenty of properties from your state or props in your component. Rather than assigning them to a variable one by one, you can use destructuring assignment.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nApp.jsx\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n\r\n   constructor(props) {\r\n      super(props);\r\n\r\n      this.state = {\r\n         users: \"Users from state...\",\r\n         counter: \"Counter from state...\"\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n   render() {\r\n      return (\r\n         <div>\r\n            <h1>{this.state.header}</h1>\r\n            <h2>{this.state.content}</h2>\r\n         </div>\r\n      );\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nexport default App;\r\n\r\n\r\n// no destructuring way of assigning these variable down in the code\r\nconst users = this.state.users;\r\nconst counter = this.state.counter;\r\n\r\n// destructuring way of assigning these variable down in the code\r\nconst { users, counter } = this.state;\r\n```\r\nThat’s especially beneficial for functional stateless components, because they always receive the props object in their function signature. Often you will not use the props but its content, so you can destructure the content already in the function signature.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// no destructuring\r\nfunction Greeting(props) {\r\n  return <h1>{props.greeting}</h1>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// destructuring\r\nfunction Greeting({ greeting }) {\r\n  return <h1>{greeting}</h1>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n1> [https://hackernoon.com/understanding-the-destructuring-assignment-syntax-in-javascript-c3bf8e1e908a](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-the-destructuring-assignment-syntax-in-javascript-c3bf8e1e908a)\r\n"

The target property gets the element on which the event originally occurred. So, event.target references DOM element.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_target.asp\r\n\r\n\r\nB> HTML <input> **name** Attribute - This is a native-html element in browser. The name attribute specifies the name of an <input> element.\r\n\r\nThe name attribute is used to reference elements in a JavaScript, or to reference form data after a form is submitted.\r\n\r\n#### Note: Only form elements with a name attribute will have their values passed when submitting a form.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_name.asp\r\n\r\n\r\nC> HTML <input> **value** Attribute - Just like <name> this is a native-html element in browser. As it happens, the DOM node for an <input> element has a ‘value’ property that holds its latest value. I am accessing this from within an handleChange() or onChange() function by e.target.value\r\n\r\nSo, [for the below code](https://github.com/rohan-paul/React-snippets/blob/master/redux-show-list-of-micro-blog-posts/src/components/PostForm-before-Redux.js), under the return() section, I am setting the value of ‘value’ attribute ( which is a property of DOM node's <input> element) as below to take the latest states of the attributes.\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvalue={this.state.title}\r\nvalue={this.state.body}\r\n```\r\n[And the original code - the link above](https://github.com/rohan-paul/React-snippets/blob/master/redux-show-list-of-micro-blog-posts/src/components/PostForm-before-Redux.js)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nonChange(e) {\r\n          this.setState ({\r\n            [e.target.name] : e.target.value\r\n          });\r\n      }\r\n\r\nrender() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <h1>Add Post</h1>\r\n            <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>\r\n                <div>\r\n                    <label>Title: </label>\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <input\r\n                        type=\"text\"\r\n                        name=\"title\"\r\n                        onChange={this.onChange}\r\n                        value={this.state.title}\r\n                    />\r\n                </div>\r\n                <br />\r\n                <div>\r\n                    <label>Body: </label>\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <textarea\r\n                        name=\"body\"\r\n                        onChange={this.onChange}\r\n                        value={this.state.body}\r\n                    />\r\n                    <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </form>\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### < [e.target.name] : e.target.value > --- EXPLANATION -\r\n\r\nA> My purpose here in the above is that -\r\n    (i) Whatever I type in the 2 input elements within form section, it should update the \"title\" and \"body\" states by assigning that typed text as the 2 state's assigned-values.\r\n\r\n    (ii) So, to achieve that, I have to first find a hook to grab, for example the first state which is \"title\". So, when I am typing in the 'title' section of the html > that means < e.target.name > is 'title' and so, > My hook for grabbing that state, is < e.target.name > and then I am setting that equal to the value of 'value' attribute ( value being a property of DOM node's <input> element ) with < e.target.value >\r\n\r\n    ( Note as mentioned above, all DOM node for an <input> element has a 'value' property and also a 'name' property - these are native html properties of the browser )\r\n\r\nB> And in the above line the part within square-bracket [e.target.name] is called the computed property value (a new addition to ES6) and I am setting that to be equal to e.target.value\r\n\r\nC> So, I am creating the onChange() function, which will update whatever the current states to the new value of <e.target.value>  And then in the return section I will just invoke this function.\r\nI am setting e.target.name which is currently \"title\" and \"body\" initially to be assigned to whatever I type (which will be captured by the code < e.target.value> )\r\n\r\nD> In the React-Dev-Tool, I can check this with a running server  >\r\n\r\nIn React-Dev-Tool > Expand App > Expand Postform   - that as soon as I am typing something to the 2 input elements, whose name attributes are “title” and “body” respectively - the 2 states in my Postform component is immediately updated to those typed-strings. And for this state updates to happen, I dont need (checked by me by commenting those 2 lines out) the below 2 lines in the return section ( as the state updates is completely taken care of by the onChange function)\r\n\r\nvalue={this.state.title}\r\nvalue={this.state.body}"

There’s a few reasons for this. The first is that JavaScript objects are lightweight — React can create and destroy these elements without too much overhead. The second reason is React is able to analyze the object, diff it with the previous object representation to see what changed, and then update the actual DOM only where those changes occurred.\r\n"

Can you identify two problems ?\r\n\r\n ```js\r\n\r\n class MyComponent extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    // set the default internal state\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      clicks: 0\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    this.refs.myComponentDiv.addEventListener('click', this.clickHandler);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentWillUnmount() {\r\n    this.refs.myComponentDiv.removeEventListener('click', this.clickHandler);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  clickHandler() {\r\n    this.setState({\r\n      clicks: this.clicks + 1\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n\r\n    let children = this.props.children;\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"my-component\" ref=\"myComponentDiv\">\r\n        <h2>My Component ({this.state.clicks} clicks})</h2>\r\n        <h3>{this.props.headerText}</h3>\r\n        {children}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n ```\r\n## Issues with the above code\r\n\r\n### 1> The constructor does not pass its props to the super class. It should include the following line:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconstructor(props) {\r\n        super(props);\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2> The event listener (when assigned via addEventListener()) is not properly scoped because ES2015 doesn’t provide autobinding. Therefore the developer can re-assign clickHandler in the constructor to include the correct binding to this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconstructor(props) {\r\n        super(props);\r\n              this.clickHandler = this.clickHandler.bind(this);\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Can you explain what the output of the above class actually does? How would you use it in an application?\r\n\r\nThis class creates a <div /> element and attaches a click listener to it. The content of this component includes a <h2 /> element that updates every time the user clicks on the parent <div />, as well as an <h3 /> element containing a provided title and whatever child elements were passed to it.\r\n\r\nTo use this class, I should import it into another class and use it like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<MyComponent headerText=\"A list of paragraph tags\">\r\n    <p>First child.</p>\r\n    <p>Any other <span>number</span> of children...</p>\r\n</MyComponent>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation of ``this.props.children`` in the above class declaration\r\n\r\n\r\n## What are children?\r\n\r\nThe children, in React, refer to the generic box whose contents are unknown until they’re passed from the parent component.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? It simply means that the component will display whatever is included in between the opening and closing tags while invoking the component. The component would usually be invoked from App component.\r\n\r\nRefer to the official documentation about the same [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html).\r\n\r\n#### props.children is rarely used in real projects because of lack of the necessity and difficulty to micro-manage compared to props, but there can be a few such cases that would make sense of it, look at my calculator tutorial!\r\n\r\n```\r\nComponent\r\n> Child\r\n> AnotherChild\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll these children can be accessed as ``this.props.children``\r\n\r\nThe power of the children is it can be anything.\r\n\r\n### The possible usage are:\r\n\r\n- Grouping unknown number of similar elements into a parent element.\r\n- You don’t know elements ahead of the time.\r\n- The nested structure that needs a wrapper.\r\n- The performance remains same with passing props and getting them via props.children, there’s nothing to worry about performance issues.\r\n\r\n#### If sending props is a possibility, avoid using props.children as it’ll be difficult to manage data passed as children as the application grows and needs changes.\r\n\r\n#### If multiple components need the same children, consider assigning them to the variable in render and then pass as children, I have done the same with the above example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### ************************************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\n\r\n1> https://www.codementor.io/blog/5-essential-reactjs-interview-questions-du1084ym1\r\n\r\n2> https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-props-children-in-react-661e1b6e45c3"

Under the hood it’s what’s keeping track of session history for React Router. When a component is rendered by React Router, that component is passed three different props: location, match, and history. This history prop comes from the History library and has a ton of fancy properties on it related to routing. In this case, the one we’re interested is history.push. What it does is it pushes a new entry onto the history stack - **aka redirecting the user to another route**.\r\n\r\nMost obvious implementation will be in a handleClick or onSubmit - after clicking / submitting I wanto the user to get redirected to a new URL and also simultaneously add this page to browser history\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/eduard-tkv/94592d77a047c1242c7be9a9fd39e439\r\n\r\n```js\r\nhandleClick(e) {\r\n    e.preventDefault()\r\n    this.props.history.push('/redirected');\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Another implementation - Here, in the onSubmit method, I submit an axios.post which will hit the back-end to upload new data to the mongo database. And after that, I want the page to be redirected to the '/dashboard' page.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nonSubmit = (e) => { \r\n  e.preventDefault();\r\n  const { date, time, tideHeightInMeters } = this.state;\r\n  axios.post('/api/tidal', { date, time, tideHeightInMeters })\r\n  this.props.history.push('/dashboard');\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd then inside the return statement, I will have the below line (the oft-repeated pattern in all form submission)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>\r\n```"

The basic way to do that is to propagate props from the root of your app (which maintains a state) as presented below:\r\n\r\n### App.js:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport DisplayHello from \"./DisplayHello\";\r\nimport DisplayQuestion from \"./DisplayQuestion\";\r\n\r\nclass App extends Component {\r\n  state = {\r\n    username: \"ovrsea\"\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <DisplayHello username={this.state.username} />\r\n        <DisplayQuestion username={this.state.username} />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### DisplayHello.js:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nclass DisplayHello extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <p>Hello {this.props.username} !</p>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default DisplayHello;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### DisplayQuestion.js:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nclass DisplayQuestion extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <div>What do you want to order today, {this.props.username} ?</div>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default DisplayQuestion;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it could become heavy to handle if you have a lot of information and/or components. It is not the role of the root to handle your app data ! This is where HOC are useful. We create a component which “pushes” the info to the components which need them ! How does it work ? It is just a function that takes a component as input and returns the same component with new props. The code of this magic trick is below :\r\n\r\n### ourFirstStore Higher Order Compoenent\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nexport default function ourFirstStore(WrappedComponent) {\r\n  return class extends Component {\r\n    state = {\r\n      username: \"ovrsea\"\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n      return (\r\n        <WrappedComponent username={this.state.username} {...this.props} />\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### DisplayHello updated:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport ourFirstStore from \"./ourFirstStore\";\r\n\r\nclass DisplayHello extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <p>Hello {this.props.username} !</p>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ourFirstStore(DisplayHello);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### DisplayQuestion updated:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport ourFirstStore from \"./ourFirstStore\";\r\n\r\nclass DisplayQuestion extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <div>What do you want to order today, {this.props.username} ?</div>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ourFirstStore(DisplayQuestion);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### And App.js updated\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport DisplayHello from \"./DisplayHello\";\r\nimport DisplayQuestion from \"./DisplayQuestion\";\r\n\r\nclass App extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <DisplayHello />\r\n        <DisplayQuestion />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### You can notice that all the data is now in the wrapper and not in App.js anymore. We just created a very basic data store accessible anywhere in your app !\r\n\r\n### Redux uses the same idea to give you the possibility to access the data, but also to modify your store. And as we have seen, this data and methods are accessible through props. This is why we have to… mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps !\r\n"

Not as in “update the DOM render,” but just to call the render method to change the virtual DOM. We can help React out by telling it when it should and shouldn’t render. Let’s look at both of those in turn...\r\n\r\n#### 1. The component’s state changes\r\n\r\nA re-render can only be triggered if a component’s state has changed. The state can change from a props change, or from a direct setState change. The component gets the updated state and React decides if it should re-render the component. Unfortunately, by default React is incredibly simplistic and basically re-renders everything all the time.\r\n\r\nComponent changed? Re-render. Parent changed? Re-render. Section of props that doesn't actually impact the view changed? Re-render.\r\n\r\n#### 2. shouldComponentUpdate method\r\n\r\nBy default, shouldComponentUpdate returns true. That’s what causes the “update everything all the time” we saw above. However, you can overwrite shouldComponentUpdate to give it more “smarts” if you need the performance boost. Instead of letting React re-render all the time, you can tell React when you don’t want to trigger a re-render.\r\n\r\nWhen React comes to render the component it will run shouldComponentUpdate and see if it returns true (the component should update, a.k.a. re-render) or false (React can skip the re-render this time). So you’ll need to overwrite shouldComponentUpdate to return true or false as needed to tell React when to re-render and when to skip.\r\n\r\n#### There are two steps of what we may call \"render\":\r\n\r\nVirtual DOM render: when render method called it returns a new virtual dom structure of the component. As I mentioned before, this render method called always when yor make setState(), because shouldComponentUpdate always returns true be default. So, by default, there is no optimisation here in React.\r\n\r\nNative DOM render: React changes real DOM nodes in your browser only if they were changed in the Virtual DOM and as little as needed - this is that great React's feature which optimizes real DOM mutation and makes React fast.\r\n\r\n#### The virtual DOM changes would trigger diffing process. Diffing process is where the virtual DOM is checked with real DOM for the reconciliation process. Though there is no repaint, there is still diffing cost+virtual DOM creation cost involved.\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "## Keys - Always use key attribute for <li> elements\r\n\r\nKeys in React are utilised to identify specific Virtual DOM Elements that have changed. The classic example of usage of keys is a list. Keys are important when rendering collections of items in React. They are used under the hood by React to determine what needs to be rendered or re-rendered.\r\n\r\n## Why you need keys for collections in React\r\n\r\nBecause **React does not render duplicate keys.**\r\n\r\nLet’s consider this array of numbers:\r\n\r\nconst nums = [1, 2, 3, 5, 2];\r\n(Notice the duplicate value, ‘2’)\r\n\r\nNow let’s take that array, and render it:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<ul>\r\n  {nums.map(num => <li key={num}>{num}</li>)}\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\nHere we’re just using the numbers themselves as the keys.\r\n\r\nIn plain HTML, the above React snippet will create an element structure like this:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li key=\"1\">1</li>\r\n  <li key=\"2\">2</li>\r\n  <li key=\"3\">3</li>\r\n  <li key=\"5\">5</li>\r\n  <li key=\"2\">2</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nReact equates elements with matching keys, thus it will only render the first ‘2’, since when it reaches the second element with a key of ‘2’, it’s already rendered an element that same key. \r\n\r\nReact will even give you a nice warning something like: \"Encountered two children with same key...\"\r\n\r\nThe output DOM is then:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>1</li>\r\n  <li>2</li>\r\n  <li>3</li>\r\n  <li>5</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n#### (Notice the lack of the second 2 in the above)\r\n\r\n#### This makes sense, because if you consider that the key is a unique identifier for a conceptual element, react doesn’t want to waste time rendering both. It’s already rendered the canonical representation of the ‘2’ element, so it doesn’t do it again.\r\n\r\n#### Now lets take a simple basic example of an array of objects:\r\n\r\n``fruits = [{name: \"Pineapple\", id: 1}, {name: \"Banana\", id: 2}, {name: \"Passion Fruit\", id: 3}``\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we were to pass this array as a prop to a FruitList component in order to render a list of fruits onto the page, we would iterate through our array of fruits, rendering each one as a list item:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst FruitList = (props) => {\r\n    const fruits = props.fruits.map(fruit =>\r\n    <li>{fruit.name}</li>\r\n   )\r\n   return (\r\n       <ul>\r\n        {fruits}\r\n       </ul>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works and does indeed render the list of fruits. However at any moment we might want to add new fruits, as well as delete or modify the existing ones. How would React know to perform those changes efficiently? That’s where the key attribute comes in handy. There are usually several choices for creating element’s unique identity. One of them is using existing IDs of each object:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst FruitList = (props) => {\r\n    const fruits = props.fruits.map(fruit =>\r\n    <li key={fruit.id}>{fruit.name}</li>\r\n   )\r\n   return (\r\n       <ul>\r\n        {fruits}\r\n       </ul>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou might also find yourself in a situation when items in your array don’t really possess a unique ID. In case of no stable IDs for rendered items, index of iterator may be used as a key.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst FruitList = (props) => {\r\n    const fruits = props.fruits.map((fruit, index) =>\r\n    <li key={index.id}>{fruit.name}</li>\r\n   )\r\n   return (\r\n       <ul>\r\n        {fruits}\r\n       </ul>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Why not to use Arry index as keys while rending a list of array elements\r\n\r\n### 1St Reason for not using array-index - Performance - React will re-render elements whose content has changed for a specific key. React also re-renders elements whose key has changed for a specific element’s contents, even if the content hasn’t changed. These two cases are indistinguishable from React’s point of view. The below is an example of this creating performance issues in certain cases when using array-index as keys.\r\n\r\n#### React can’t tell with a simple equality check wheather to re-render or not, because every time a JSX element is created, that’s a brand new object, unequal to the old one. So that’s where the key prop comes in. React can look at the key and know that, yes, even though this <Item> is not strictly === to the old <Item>, it actually is the same because the keys are the same.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at how React will render this list of users when using the index as a key.\r\n\r\nconst users = [\r\n  {username:'bob'},\r\n  {username:'sue'}\r\n];\r\n\r\nusers.map((u, i) =>\r\n  <div key={i}>{u.username}</div>);\r\nThis will render elements like:\r\n\r\n<div key=\"1\">bob</div>\r\n<div key=\"2\">sue</div>\r\nNow let’s suppose that we add a user to the front of the list:\r\n\r\nconst users = [\r\n  {username:'joe'},\r\n  {username:'bob'},\r\n  {username:'sue'}\r\n];\r\n\r\nusers.map((u, i) =>\r\n  <div key={i}>{u.username}</div>);\r\nThis will render elements like:\r\n\r\n<div key=\"1\">joe</div>\r\n<div key=\"2\">bob</div>\r\n<div key=\"3\">sue</div>\r\n\r\nAfter we add another user, React will go into reconciliation, where it will update the dom depending on the shape of the elements returned from the component’s render function. It does this by comparing the new render result to the previous one. If anything is different, React will go through with the expensive Dom update operation.\r\n\r\nHere is the previous result of the operation compared to the new result:\r\n\r\n<div key=\"1\">bob</div>   |  <div key=\"1\">joe</div>\r\n<div key=\"2\">sue</div>   >  <div key=\"2\">bob</div>\r\n                         |  <div key=\"3\">sue</div>\r\n\r\nIt’s clear by looking at the two side by side that we’ve simply added “joe” to the beginning of the list.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the most efficient way to go from the previous dom structure to the next? Obviously, it’s simply to add just the one dom element to the beginning, and leave the previous to unchanged. \r\n\r\n#### BUT React cannot determine this, and it’s because we’ve used the indices as our identifiers, (instead of basing that identifier on the actual content that is rendered).\r\n\r\nFrom React’s perspective, it looks like we’ve:\r\n\r\nChanged the element with id “1” from bob to joe,\r\nChanged the element with id “2” from sue to bob,\r\nAdded a new element with id “3”, sue.\r\n\r\nReact will apply all three of these changes, instead of simply adding one.\r\n\r\n#### 2nd Reason for not using array-index - Stability - In some other times, using the index as keys while rendering a list of items with a map() function, will make React simpley pick up the wrong element, after I add a new item to the list. \r\n#### Because one of the basic principle while selecting keys of rendering of a list, is that of \"Stability\" i.e. - The key for the same element should not change with time, or page refresh, or re-ordering of elements. Array indexes are unique, and predictable. However, they are not stable, because after I add a new item to the front of the list, that new item will take the foremost index position of the array pushing back the previous top most postioned item.\r\n\r\n### How setting keys is so VERY important for Performance and in sync with React's core Engineering Philosophy of re-rendering of what is required\r\n\r\nWe can hint the react to preserve the existing instance of component by providing “key” props, so that it can get saved from getting unmounted\r\n\r\nIf we’ve list of items to be rendered in (li tag) and those list-items can get re-ordered or rearranged at any time (eg: adding item between two items).\r\n\r\n### So, in that case if we are missing the value for “key” props in li elements, then on every re-render cycle react will unmount all the item-node and re-mount back again the same node with updated sequence.\r\n\r\nSo in order to avoid this provide the value for “key” props which is going to be unique for the item-row and also the value should be same (therefore, avoid using array index as value for the key) through out the multiple re-rendering cycle. Because the value of “key” props will act as identifier for react so that it can help in persisting those item across further re-rendering cycle.\r\n\r\n### Lets go through an actual example of adding a <li> element to an <ul> tree\r\n[https://dzone.com/articles/dom-manipulation-in-react](https://dzone.com/articles/dom-manipulation-in-react)\r\n\r\n### Whenever setState() method is called, ReactJS creates the whole Virtual DOM from scratch. Creating a whole tree is very fast so it does not affect the performance.\r\n### Once you render a JSX element, every single Virtual DOM object gets updated.Compared to updating real DOM objects, the Virtual DOM updates faster. Before updating, a copy of the virtual DOM is made and later compared with the updated Virtual DOM.\r\n### So at any given time, ReactJS maintains two virtual DOM, one with the updated state Virtual DOM and other with the previous state Virtual DOM. Then React can figure out which objects have been changed, and this process is called Diffing. Once React knows which objects to update, it updates only those objects in the Real DOM.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n// List1:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li> Child1 </li>\r\n     <li> Child2 </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n// List2:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Child1 </li>\r\n    <li> Child2 </li>\r\n    <li> Child3 </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, a new child <li> has been added to the end of the list. Now, React iterates over both lists and inserts the third child to the DOM. It matches every child, and if there is no difference, moves to the next, and generates a mutation, when there’s a difference. But this is fine as the new child is added to the end of the list. A problem arises when the new element is added at the beginning of the list. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nList1:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n     <li> Child1 </li>\r\n     <li> Child2 </li>\r\n</ul>\r\nList2:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> Child3 </li>\r\n    <li> Child1 </li>\r\n    <li> Child2 </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n```\r\nNow, React compares the first elements and finds that there is a difference and the element is mutated. The same happens to the next elements as well. So, without knowing it, it is rebuilding the entire list again. This reduces the performance when compared to adding the child at the beginning of the list.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, React supports an attribute, Key.\r\n\r\n## Comparing Keys\r\n\r\nIf the attribute key is added to the child element, React compares the values in key of the first tree, and matches it to the key value in the second tree.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n// List1:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li key=”101” > Child1 </li>\r\n    <li key=”102” > Child2 </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n// List2:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li key=”100” > Child3 </li>\r\n    <li key=”101” > Child1 </li>\r\n    <li key=”102” > Child2 </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\nHere, React will know that a new child element with key=\"100\" has been added to the list, and the rest were moved down. Hence, it’ll not rebuild the entire list again. This will improve the performance of DOM Manipulation.\r\n\r\n### What to use for good key selection\r\n\r\nAny key that you are going to use should be —\r\n\r\n#### 1> Unique — The key of an element should be unique among its siblings. It is not necessary to have globally unique keys.\r\n\r\n#### 2> Stable — The key for the same element should not change with time, or page refresh, or re-ordering of elements.\r\n\r\n#### 3> Predictable — You can always get the same key again if you want. That is, the key should not be generated randomly.\r\n\r\n#### 4> Permanent – An item’s key must not change between re-renders, unless that item is different. So, Math.random is a bad choice for a key (it’ll change every time… and it might not be unique (slim chance of that, though))\r\n\r\n**Array indexes are unique, and predictable. However, they are not stable**. In the same vein, random numbers or timestamps should not be used as keys.\r\n\r\nIn general, you should rely on the ID generated by databases such as primary key in Relational databases, and Object IDs in Mongo. If a database ID is not available, you can generate a hash of the content and use that as a key.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n[https://paulgray.net/keys-in-react/](https://paulgray.net/keys-in-react/)"

It is also taking super’s return value and passing it back to the caller.\r\n\r\n### A hypothetical ES6 Class Component might look something like this (over-simplified without error checking, of course).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Foo extends Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = { loading: true };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  async componentDidMount() {\r\n    const data = await loadStuff();\r\n    this.setState({ loading: false, data });\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { loading, data } = this.state;\r\n    return (\r\n      {loading ? <Loading /> : <View {...data} />}\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWe initialize our state in the constructor, asynchronously load our data in componentDidMount, and render our View component based on the loading state.\r\n\r\n#### Now without the constructor (using ES-7) I can shorten it like below.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Foo extends Component {\r\n  state = { loading: true };\r\n\r\n  async componentDidMount() {\r\n    const data = await loadStuff();\r\n    this.setState({ loading: false, data });\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { loading, data } = this.state;\r\n    return (\r\n      {loading ? <Loading /> : <View {...data} />}\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Initializing state with props - What about when you need to derive your initial state from props, say for initializing a default value? Surely we need the constructor for that?\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Foo extends Component {\r\n\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      color: this.props.initialColor\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { color } = this.state;\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n       {color}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNope! Again, class properties to the rescue! We have access to both this and props.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Foo extends Component {\r\n  state = {\r\n    color: this.props.initialColor\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe’ve seen that for setting our initial state, we no longer need a constructor (or any other instance property for that matter). We also don’t need it for binding methods to this. Same for setting initial state from props. And we would most definitely never fetch data in the constructor.\r\n\r\nWhy then would we ever need the constructor in a React component?\r\n\r\nWell… you don’t."

This for example\r\n\r\n```js\r\ndocument.querySelector\r\n('input').onchange = function(event) {\r\n  document.querySelector('code').textContent = event.target.value;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let's talk about what this is useful for. One great example is a sign-up form where you have to pick a username or type in an email address or something. Before the user gets around to pressing the final submit button you might want to alert them early that their chosen username is available or already taken. Or you might want to alert early that the typed in email address is not a valid one. If you execute that kind of validation on every key stroke, it's unlikely to be a pleasant UI.\r\n\r\nProblem is, you can't do that in ReactJS. It doesn't work like that.\r\n\r\n``\"<input type=\"text\" value=\"Untitled\"> ``\r\n\r\nThe above renders an input initialized with the value, 'Untitled'. When the user updates the input, the node's value property will change. However, ``node.getAttribute('value')`` will still return the value used at initialization time, Untitled.\r\n\r\n## Unlike HTML, React components must represent the state of the view at any point in time and not only at initialization time.\"*\r\n\r\n## Basically, you can't easily rely on the input field because the state needs to come from the React app's state, NOT from the browser's idea of what the value should be.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Input extends Component {\r\n\r\n  getInitialState: function() {\r\n    return {typed: ''};\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  onChange: function(event) {\r\n    this.setState({typed: event.target.value});\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  render: function() {\r\n    return <div>\r\n        <input type=\"text\" onChange={this.onChange.bind(this)}/>\r\n        You typed: <code>{this.state.typed}</code>\r\n      </div>\r\n  }\r\n});\r\nReact.render(<Input/>, document.querySelector('div'));\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## A nice example - Check my below implementation to see how data from child is coming from onChange() function defined in child to update parent's state in the input field.\r\n\r\nIn the below Items.js (parent) - I have the state (searchTerm) defined.

And that searchTerm state is in the parent Item.js component, and from this child Filter.js component, I am just passing the input data upstreap which will update that state in the parent.\r\n\r\n\r\n### So overall mechanism and the work-flow of the filter functionality and the parent state being changed from passing data from child -\r\n\r\nA> The user types something in the <input> field captured by \"value\" attribute of <input> field.\r\n\r\nB> That \"value\" attribute is assigned to the variable 'searchTerm' (which is a prop passed from parent Items.js to child Filter.js)\r\n\r\nC> Then this searchTerm is passed upstream from child to parent and passed as the argument to updateSearchTerm() function. This happens because whatever input 'value' is assigned for searchTerm in Filter.js , in Items.js searchTerm would get the same value.\r\n\r\nD) And then in Items.js with setState inside updateSearchTerm() function, this searchTerm will be the new state.\r\n\r\nE) And then the **updateSearchTerm**() function gets passed ONLY in **Filter.js** inside handleChange() function by the line\r\n\r\n``< onChange(value) >``\r\n\r\nBut then, I have to execute handleChange() function so the updateSearchTerm() function gets the opportunity to execute as well.\r\n\r\nAnd thats what I do inside the return() statement - handleChange() function gets executed whenever user changes the content of the input field with below line\r\n\r\n``onChange={this.handleChange}``\r\n\r\n\r\n### Some Reading\r\n\r\n1> [https://www.peterbe.com/plog/onchange-in-reactjs](https://www.peterbe.com/plog/onchange-in-reactjs)"

What that means is when you want to create a new route, you render a Route component. If you’re familiar with React Router you know that to do that, you pass Route a path and a component to render when the app’s location matches that path.\r\n\r\n``<Route path='/dashboard' component={Dashboard} />``\r\n\r\nNow, what if we also wanted to pass Dashboard a prop? There’s a few different ways to solve this problem but only one right way. The first idea you might have is to just pass it as a prop on Route.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<Route\r\n  path='/dashboard'\r\n  component={Dashboard}\r\n  isAuthed={true}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately, this won’t work. React Router won’t forward that prop onto the component. Instead, it will just ignore it.\r\n\r\nThe next idea you might have, and a pattern I’ve seen a few places is to pass component an inline function that creates the element.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<Route\r\n  path='/dashboard'\r\n  component={() => <Dashboard isAuthed={true} />}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\nThough technically this will work, it’s not the best solution. The reason for this is because of performance. According to the offical docs…\r\n\r\n### “When you use the component props, the router uses React.createElement to create a new React element from the given component. That means if you provide an inline function to the component attribute, you would create a new component every render. This results in the existing component unmounting and the new component mounting instead of just updating the existing component.”\r\n\r\nSo if you’re not supposed to pass a function to component, what’s the solution? Turns out the React Router team predicted this problem and gave us a handy solution. Instead of using component, use the render prop. render accepts a functional component and that function won’t get unnecessarily remounted like with component. That function will also receive all the same props that component would receive. So you can take those and pass those along to the rendred component.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<Route\r\n  path='/dashboard'\r\n  render={(props) => <Dashboard {...props} isAuthed={true} />}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n### So to recap, if you need to pass a prop to a component being rendered by React Router, instead of using Routes component prop, use its render prop passing it an inline function then pass along the arguments to the element you’re creating.\r\n\r\nSource: https://tylermcginnis.com/react-router-pass-props-to-components/\r\n\r\n#### Another implementation in my little MERN signup form with passport, and bcrypt\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/rohan-paul/SignUp-Form-with-Passport/blob/master/src/App.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/SignUp-Form-with-Passport/blob/master/src/App.js)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrender() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"App\">\r\n\r\n        <Navbar updateUser={this.updateUser} loggedIn={this.state.loggedIn} />\r\n        {/* greet user if logged in: */}\r\n        {this.state.loggedIn &&\r\n          <p>Join the party, {this.state.username}!</p>\r\n        }\r\n        {/* Routes to different components */}\r\n        <Route\r\n          exact path=\"/\"\r\n          component={Home} />\r\n        <Route\r\n          path=\"/login\"\r\n          render={() =>\r\n            <LoginForm\r\n              updateUser={this.updateUser}\r\n            />}\r\n        />\r\n        <Route\r\n          path=\"/signup\"\r\n          render={() =>\r\n            <Signup/>}\r\n        />\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n  ```"

Since we are using local state, we need a way for the child component to tell the parent component to call setState. One way to solve this is to create a function in the parent component and add it as a property on the object passed to our render prop. Then whenever the child component needs to update state, it calls this function.\r\n\r\nThis function then executes in the parent context and calls setState. Once setState is run, if any state value has changed, those new values propagate down into our render prop and the child component now receives the new value.\r\n\r\n### For passing from child to parent - pass one callback function from parent to child and then use this passed-down function in the child to send something back to parent.\r\n\r\nSame tutorial - https://medium.com/@ruthmpardee/passing-data-between-react-components-103ad82ebd17\r\n\r\n### A> Define a callback in my parent which takes the data I need in as a parameter.\r\n\r\n### B> Pass that callback as a prop to the child.\r\n\r\n### C> Call the callback using this.props.[callback] in the child (insert your own name where it says [callback] of course), and pass in the data as the argument.\r\n\r\nHere’s what that might look like if I had data in **ToDoItem** (the Child Component) that I need to access in **ToDoList**(The parent Component) : And the data that **ToDoList** will receive from the child **ToDoItem** is given a variable name **listInfo** for example.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Parent component\r\nclass ParentToDoList extends React.Component {\r\n\r\n    myCallback = (dataFromChild) => {\r\n     //  [...we will use the dataFromChild here...]\r\n    },\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                 <ChildToDoItem callbackFromParent={this.myCallback}/>\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Now from within ToDoItem (The Child Component) we can pass something to callbackFromParent (the prop that was given the value or assigned the value of the CB function that was defined in the parent ) :\r\n\r\n// Child component\r\nclass ChildToDoItem extends React.Component {\r\n    someFn = () => {\r\n        // [...somewhere in here I define a variable listInfo which I think will be useful as data in my ToDoList component...]\r\n        this.props.callbackFromParent(listInfo);\r\n    },\r\n    render() {\r\n        [...]\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nToDoList will now be able to use listInfo within it’s myCallback function!\r\n\r\n### But what if I want to use 'listInfo' in a different function within ToDoList, not just in myCallback so I get 'listInfo' as a regular variable in the parent component ? With the above implementation, I would only have access as a parameter passed into that one specific method.\r\n\r\n#### Easy: set this parameter as a state within ToDoList. You can almost think of it as creating a variable within the scope of ToDoList that all the methods within that component can access. In that case my code defining ToDoList might look something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass ToDoList extends React.Component {\r\n    constructor(props) {\r\n        super(props);\r\n        this.state = {\r\n            listDataFromChild: null\r\n        };\r\n    },\r\n    myCallback = (dataFromChild) => {\r\n        this.setState({ listDataFromChild: dataFromChild });\r\n    },\r\n    otherFn = () => {\r\n       // ..within this other function now I still have access to this.state.listDataFromChild...\r\n    }\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                 <ToDoItem callbackFromParent={this.myCallback}/>\r\n                 [...now here I can pass this.state.listDataFromChild as a prop to any other child component...]\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Another Implementation of the above concept in below file -\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/rohan-paul/Fetch-Github-Profile/blob/master/simple-version-without-using-redux/src/App.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/Fetch-Github-Profile/blob/master/simple-version-without-using-redux/src/App.js)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nApp.js is Parent and SearchProfile and Profile are the children.\r\n\r\nDefine a callback in my parent which takes the data I need in as a parameter.\r\n\r\nPass that callback as a prop to the child (see above).\r\n\r\nCall the callback using this.props.[callback] in the child (insert your own name where it says [callback] of course), and pass in the data as the argument.\r\n\r\nfetchProfile() is a callback function defined in parent. This takes the data I need as an argument. But the data will come from the child component SearhProfile\r\n\r\nSo, I pass this callback function to the child-Component SearchProfile as a prop, with the below line\r\n\r\n`<SearchProfile fetchProfileBoundFunction={this.fetchProfile.bind(this)}/>`\r\n\r\nCall the callback (fetchProfileBoundFunction) using this.props.[callback] in the child and pass in the data as the argument.\r\nSo in SearchProfile I do < this.props.fetchProfileBoundFunction(username) >\r\n\r\n## Even Another Implementation of the above concept in below file -\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/rohan-paul/check-pack-items-before-travel/blob/master/src/components/Items.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/check-pack-items-before-travel/blob/master/src/components/Items.js)\r\n\r\nupdateSearchTerm() in parent component Items.js - Fundamental explanation why I need it at all - Because, here, my most fundamental need is to change the searchTerm ( the parent state ) to whatever I type. But then, I am updating this searchTerm from the child and passing down 'searchTerm' as a prop from parent to child. And Prop is immutable, so I can not directly change 'searchTerm' in the Filter.js\r\nSo, instead I can give the child a function ( updateSearchTerm() in this file ), that the child can call, and that function can manipulate the state.\r\n\r\n// parent component\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Items extends Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      searchTerm: \"\"\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  updateSearchTerm = searchTerm => {\r\n    this.setState({\r\n      searchTerm\r\n    });\r\n  };\r\n  /* In above, I am using object destructuring syntax. So the single 'searchTerm' is equivalent to doing < searchTerm: searchTerm >  Which effectively means tha I am telling setState 'Hey take the searchTerm argument of updateSearchTerm() function and set them to be the value of the key-value pair of state (which is an object and both the key and the value is called 'searchTerm' ).\r\n   */\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { title, items, onRemove, onToggle } = this.props;\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <section className=\"Items\">\r\n        <h2>\r\n          {title} ({items.length})\r\n        </h2>\r\n        <Filter\r\n          searchTerm={this.state.searchTerm}\r\n          onChange={this.updateSearchTerm}\r\n        />\r\n        {items\r\n          .filter(item =>\r\n            item.value\r\n              .toLowerCase()\r\n              .includes(this.state.searchTerm.toLowerCase())\r\n          )\r\n          .map(item => (\r\n            <Item\r\n              key={item.id}\r\n              onToggle={onToggle}\r\n              onRemove={() => onRemove(item)}\r\n              item={item}\r\n            />\r\n          ))}\r\n      </section>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### And then in <Filter /> child component, I have the below. SO ITS DATA-DOWN ACTIONS-UP KIND OF FLOW\r\n\r\n#### The flow of data passing from child to parent is as below\r\n\r\n### A> onChange() is passed from parent to child.\r\n\r\n### B> event.target.value is triggerd in the Child whenever the user types something in the input field.\r\n\r\n### C> This event.target.value is captured in the 'value' variable and passed as the argument to onChange() - the function that was passed from parent to child. And onChange() is also invoked as soon as user starts typing something in the input filed.\r\n\r\n### C> And now 'updateSearchTerm' is executed in parent as well > setState() executed > and parent's state gets changed.\r\n\r\n// child component\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Filter extends Component {\r\n  // note onChange and searchTerm were the props that were handed-down from Items.js\r\n  // and so first to access / consume it inside the child I have to do a this.props\r\n  // And because this is a Functional Component without constructor, so I don't need to\r\n  // declare super(props) before using this.props\r\n  // the onChange() inside handleChange() is NOT an 'onChange' event attribute but the props passed from parent Items.js to Filter.js\r\n  // but the onChange inside return() within the <input/> element is the onChange event attribute.\r\n\r\n  handleChange = event => {\r\n    const { onChange } = this.props;\r\n    const value = event.target.value;\r\n    onChange(value);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { searchTerm } = this.props;\r\n    return (\r\n      <input\r\n        className=\"Items-searchTerm\"\r\n        value={searchTerm}\r\n        onChange={this.handleChange}\r\n      />\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Further Sources / Reading\r\n\r\n#### 1> Example of data passing from child to parent by invoking a CB (defined in parent ) in child and updating state in parent\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/rohan-paul/check-pack-items-before-travel/blob/master/src/components/NewItem.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/check-pack-items-before-travel/blob/master/src/components/NewItem.js)\r\n\r\n#### 2> React component communication\r\n\r\nhttps://www.javascriptstuff.com/component-communication/\r\n\r\n#### 3> Simple example of passing function (a function that has a setState() it it) from parent to child and invoking it in the child - thereby triggering state change in the parent (e.g. on button-click in the child)\r\n\r\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnRDdEz1FJc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnRDdEz1FJc)\r\n"

        "content": "# Parent to Child — Use Prop\r\n\r\nThis is the easiest direction in React to transfer data. If I have access to data in my parent component that I need my child component to have access to, I can pass it as a prop to the child when I instantiate it within the parent.\r\n\r\nIn my example, if I need to pass something from the parent App Component to the ToDoList Child component:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    // [... somewhere in here I define a variable listName which I think will be useful as data in my ToDoList component...]\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <InputBar />\r\n        <ToDoList listNameFromParent={listName} />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in the ToDoList child component I will access / consume the passed-in data from parent like below\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass ToDoList extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { listNameFromParent } = this.props;\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <ul>{listNameFromParent}</ul>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## However if the above ToDoList child-component was declared as a ES6-Class component with a constructor - We had to call super(props) inside the constructor BEFORE BEING ABLE TO use this.props\r\n\r\n### The reason why this cannot be allowed before super() is because this is uninitialized if super() is not called. However even if we are not using `this` we need a super inside a constructor because ES6 class constructors MUST call super if they are subclasses. Thus, you have to call super() as long as you have a constructor. (But a subclass does not have to have a constructor).\r\n\r\n#### Another example of passing data from parent to child\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// RecipeList is the parent - note I am passing 5 props down to child\r\n\r\nclass RecipeList extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div style={{ display: \"flex\" }}>\r\n        {this.props.recipes.map((item, index) => (\r\n          <Recipe\r\n            key={index}\r\n            title={item.title}\r\n            ingredients={item.ingredients}\r\n            instructions={item.instructions}\r\n            img={item.img}\r\n          />\r\n        ))}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// And then Recipe is the child - note,\r\n\r\nclass Recipe extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { title, img, instructions } = this.props;\r\n\r\n    const ingredients = this.props.ingredients.map((ing, index) => (\r\n      <li key={index}>{ing}</li>\r\n    ));\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"recipe-card\">\r\n        <div className=\"recipe-card-img\">\r\n          {\" \"}\r\n          <img src={img} alt={title} />{\" \"}\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"recipe-card-content\">\r\n          <h3 className=\"recipe-title\">Reciepe {title}</h3>\r\n          <ul> {ingredients} </ul>\r\n          <h4>Instructions:</h4>\r\n          <p>{instructions}</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Another Example - Passing simple Props from Parent to Child — where the prop is not a function\r\n\r\nInside the parent component, just do `<ChildComponent propName={this.props.propName} />` and then inside the child component just do `{this.props.propName}`\r\n\r\n[Implemented example](https://github.com/rohan-paul/React-snippets/blob/master/Wrapper-Component-Print-Users-Followers-With-Webpack-Setup/src/App.js)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <Profile\r\n          name={this.state.profileData.name}\r\n          imgURL={this.state.profileData.imgURL}\r\n        />\r\n        <Followers followerList={this.state.profileData.followerList} />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Profile extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <h3>{this.props.name}</h3>\r\n        <img src={this.props.imgURL} />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Followers extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    var followers = this.props.followerList.map(function(follower, index) {\r\n      return <li key={index}>{follower}</li>;\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <h5>My followers:</h5>\r\n        <ul>{followers}</ul>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## React component communication\r\n\r\nhttps://www.javascriptstuff.com/component-communication/\r\n\r\n### Basic Theory - https://medium.com/@ruthmpardee/passing-data-between-react-components-103ad82ebd17\r\n\r\nAlso my somewhat detailed-comments in code - [https://github.com/rohan-paul/Fetch-Github-Profile/blob/master/simple-version-without-using-redux/src/App.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/Fetch-Github-Profile/blob/master/simple-version-without-using-redux/src/App.js)\r\n\r\n#### And a great live example [https://jsbin.com/tipixiy/edit?js,output](https://jsbin.com/tipixiy/edit?js,output)\r\n"

A synthetic event is a shell around the native DOM event with additional information for React.\r\n\r\nLets see the code where\r\n\r\n- A> Initially I have a list as an array 'initialList'\r\n- B> And then add an item to that list by using a form element with input and button elements.\r\n- C> In this case, a preventDefault is called on the event when submitting the form to prevent a browser reload/refresh.\r\n-\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nconst initialList = [\"Learn React\", \"Learn Firebase\", \"Learn GraphQL\"];\r\n\r\nconst ListWithAddItem = () => {\r\n  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(\"\");\r\n  const [list, setList] = React.useState(initialList);\r\n\r\n  const handleChange = event => {\r\n    setValue(event.target.value);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const handleSubmit = event => {\r\n    if (value) {\r\n      setList(list.concat(value));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    setValue(\"\");\r\n\r\n    event.preventDefault();\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        {list.map(item => (\r\n          <li key={item}>{item}</li>\r\n        ))}\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\r\n        <input type=\"text\" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />\r\n        <button type=\"submit\">Add Item</button>\r\n      </form>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default ListWithAddItem;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout a preventDefault() a form submission will reload the browser.\r\n\r\nBecause, all native HTML elements come with their internal native behavior. For instance, input elements store their internal state. That’s why often React is used to take over for having controlled components by managing the state via React.\r\n\r\nSimilarly a Form element which has a submit event that is invoked via a submit button element, in the past, was desired to refresh the browser to flush all state and to submit the data to a backend. But with React, it gives us more flexibility to deal with the submit event ourselves by invoking the preventDefault()\r\n\r\nIn another scenario, you may fetch data from a backend and store it in your component’s state. There is no native submission from the form expected anymore, that’s why the developer is able to take over.\r\n\r\nIn another scenario, you may fetch data from a backend and store it in your component’s state. There is no native submission from the form expected anymore, and the developer should be able to take over in this situation, so he shouldn’t need to worry about any undesired behavior of the browser.\r\n\r\n#### Reading\r\n\r\n- [https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-preventdefault/](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-preventdefault/)\r\n"

You use props to pass configuration values that won't change and state to internally manage data that will change throughout a component's lifecycle. In this tutorial, we'll examine the difference between props and state including key differences and best use cases for each.\r\n\r\n## What are props?\r\n\r\nProps is short for \"properties\". The props object holds key/value pairs of a component's properties and their corresponding values:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nclass Header extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <p>Welcome back, {this.props.firstName}</p>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <Header firstName=\"Eric\" />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, within the parent App component I pass (or I set) a firstName property on the <Header /> component. This adds `{firstName: \"Eric\"}` to the props object for the Header component.\r\n\r\nWe reference the firstName property within the Header component via `this.props.firstName` . Remember that props is simply an object for the Header component class.\r\n\r\nA React component is a reusable component which can be used over and over again in the UI, but not always we are going to render the same component with same data. Sometimes we have to change the data or content inside a component. That’s why props are introduced in React. Let’s take a look how we can use props in react.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass DummyComponent extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can pass the value of the props from two different parent components like below. So the child-component (DummyComponent) remains the the exact same, but depending on which parent is rendering it, will render different value for the 'name' prop.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<DummyComponent name=\"Manoj\" />\r\n<DummyComponent name=\"Ajay\" />\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe used one react component in multiple places here but with a different name. As you can see we can pass props to our React component using attributes and then can access them inside our component using this.props pretty straightforward. Props are similar to passed arguments to a function.\r\n\r\n#### So the functional representation of the DummyComponent is like below\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst DummyFunction = name => {\r\n  console.log(`Hey ${name}`);\r\n};\r\nDummyFunction(\"Manoj\");\r\nDummyFunction(\"Ajay\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nProps make react component reusable so you can use the same component with different data every time. The same principle is used when creating functions we create a function with parameters so we can pass them different arguments every time and get different results.\r\n"

Sometime this will create a lot of re-render.\r\n\r\n#### Now first understand the rendering cycle of regular Component\r\n\r\nHere are the main events that leads to a Component update :\r\n\r\n-   A.

Another Component updating higher in the tree\r\n\r\nBoth of those things will trigger the shouldComponentUpdate() method, which decides if the rendering lifecycle should proceed.\r\n\r\nBy default **shouldComponentUpdatereturns** true, causing React to update its virtual DOM.\r\n\r\nBut a pure component, on the other hand, will not rerender if its parent rerenders, unless the pure component's props (or state) have changed.

When props or state changes, PureComponent will do a shallow comparison (see below notes for more details) on both props and state. Component on the other hand won’t compare current props and state to next out of the box. Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever shouldComponentUpdate is called.\r\n\r\nUsing PureComponent will help you prevent this wasted re-render. For instance, if a prop is a string or boolean and it changes, a PureComponent is going to recognize that, but if a property within an object is changing, a PureComponent is not going to trigger a re-render.\r\n\r\nHere’s where immutability comes in: if you’re passing props into a PureComponent, you have to make sure that those props are updated in an immutable way. That means, if they’re objects or arrays, you’ve gotta replace the entire value with a new (modified) object or array. Kill it off and replace it with a clone.\r\n\r\n**If you modify the internals of an object or array – by changing a property, or pushing a new item, or even modifying an item inside an array – then the object or array is referentially equal to its old self, and a PureComponent will not notice that it has changed, and will not re-render. Weird rendering bugs will ensue.**\r\n\r\n### A quick use case for Pure Component.\r\n\r\nFor example, lets say that we have a component tree with a three-level hierarchy: parent, children and grandchildren.\r\n\r\nWhen the parent's props are changed in a way that the props of only one child are changed, then:\r\n\r\n-   if all components are regular components, then the entire component tree will rerender\r\n\r\n-   if all children and grandchildren are pure components, then only one child will rerender, and one or all of its grandchildren, depending on whether their props are changed. If there are many components in this component tree, it may mean a significant performance boost.\r\n\r\n#### Now lets look at STATELESS Component vs Pure Component\r\n\r\nSTATELESS COMPONENT declared as a function that has no state and returns the same markup given the same props.\r\n\r\nA quote from the React documentation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThese components must not retain internal state, do not have backing instances, and do not have the component lifecycle methods. They are pure functional transforms of their input, with zero boilerplate. However, you may still specify .propTypes and .defaultProps by setting them as properties on the function, just as you would set them on an ES6 class.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### PURE COMPONENT is one of the most significant ways to optimize React applications. The usage of Pure Component gives a considerable increase in performance because it reduces the number of render operation in the application.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at a simple example\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Welcome extends React.PureComponent {\r\n\trender() {\r\n\t\treturn <h1>Welcome</h1>;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nHello = () => {\r\n\treturn <h1>Hello</h1>;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo above there is an example of a very simple Welcome Pure Component and Hello Stateless Component. **When you use these two in your Parent Component, you will see Hello will re-render whenever Parent Component will re-render but Welcome Component will not.**\r\n\r\n#### This is because PureComponent changes the life-cycle method `shouldComponentUpdate` and adds some logic to automatically check whether a re-render is required for the component. This allows a PureComponent to call the method render only if it detects changes in state or props.\r\n\r\n### When to use Pure Components?\r\n\r\nSuppose you creating a dictionary page in which you display the meaning of all the English words starting with A. Now you can write a component which takes a word and its meaning as props and return a proper view. And suppose you using pagination to display only 10 words at a time and on scroll asking (i.e. sending an API call) for another 10 words and updating the state of the parent component. Pure Components should be used in this case as it will avoid rendering of all the words which rendered in previous API request.\r\n\r\nAlso in cases where you want to use lifecycle methods of Component then we have to use Pure Components as stateless components don't have lifecycle methods.\r\n\r\n### When to use Stateless Components?\r\n\r\nSuppose you want to create a label with some beautiful UI which will be used to rate the credibility of a profile like BEGINNER, MODERATE, EXPERT. Since its a very small component whose re-render will hardly make any difference and creating a new component for such a small case will be time-consuming. Also if you keep making components for very small-small view, soon you will end up with so many components and it will be hard to manage when working with a big project. Also always keep in mind Pure Component comes with peculiarities of the shallowEqual.\r\n\r\nStateless Components are easy and fast to implement. They are good for very small UI view where re-render cost won’t matter that much. They provide cleaner code and less number of files to deal with.\r\n\r\n### What is Shallow Comparison\r\n\r\n-   A> When shallow comparing scalar values (numbers, strings) it compares their values. When comparing objects, it does not compare their attributes - only their references are compared (e.g. \"do they point to same object?).\r\n\r\n-   B> Shallow comparison is when the properties of the objects being compared is done using \"===\" or strict equality and will not conduct comparisons deeper into the properties. So if you shallow compare a deep nested object it will just check the reference not the values inside that object.\r\n\r\nIn other words, shallow comparison will check that primitives have the same value (eg, 1 equals 1 or that true equals true) and that the references are the same between more complex javascript values like objects and arrays.\r\n\r\n-   C> shallowCompare performs a shallow equality check on the current props and nextProps objects as well as the current state and nextState objects.\r\n\r\n    It does this by iterating on the keys of the objects being compared and returning true when the values of a key in each object are not strictly equal.\r\n\r\n    shallowCompare returns true if the shallow comparison for props or state fails and therefore the component should update.\r\n    shallowCompare returns false if the shallow comparison for props and state both pass and therefore the component does not need to update.\r\n    .\r\n\r\n### Further Reading\r\n\r\n1.

        "content": "**Generally people think, an easy way to optimize a React component for performance is to make it a class, and make it extend React.PureComponent instead of React.Component. This way, the component will only re-render if it’s state is changed or if it’s props have changed. It will no longer mindlessly re-render every single time its parent re-renders; it will ONLY re-render if one of its props has changed since the last render.**\r\n\r\nHowever its not as straightforward. Read this - [https://cdb.reacttraining.com/react-inline-functions-and-performance-bdff784f5578](https://cdb.reacttraining.com/react-inline-functions-and-performance-bdff784f5578) - Key takeaway from this article is - we dont have to user Pure component in all places, as it would NOT have any performance optimization effect generally. So, keep PureComponent on the shelf until you have a measurement to justify it.\r\n\r\nYou can see real performance improvements by understanding two things: shouldComponentUpdate and JavaScript strict equality comparisons.\r\n\r\n1. So, if you inline an object in your JSX, it will fail the PureComponent prop diff and move on to diffing the more expensive React elements. The element diff will come up empty and now we’ve wasted time on both diffs. Since functions are objects and PureComponent does a strict equality check on props, an inline function will always fail the prop diff and move on to the element diff in the reconciler.\r\n2. If a component usually changes when there’s an update, then a PureComponent will be doing two diffs instead of just one (props and state in shouldComponentUpdate, and then the normal element diff).\r\n\r\nWhy - Think about it. If you have a Component how many diffs are there? If you have a PureComponent how many diffs are there? The answers are “just one” and “at least one and sometimes two”, respectively. If a component usually changes when there’s an update, then a PureComponent will be doing two diffs instead of just one (props and state in shouldComponentUpdate, and then the normal element diff). Which means it’s going to be slower usually but faster occasionally. Apparently, most of my components changed most of the time, so on the whole, my app got slower. Oops.\r\n\r\nOops - (Meaning after refactoring bunch of my regular component with Pure Component, the App actually got slower). So keep PureComponent on the shelf until you have a measurement to justify it.\r\n\r\n#### Now some scenarios\r\n\r\n#### 1-st Scenario\r\n\r\n#### DOM component event handler\r\n\r\n````js\r\n\r\n<button\r\n  onClick={() => this.setState(…)}\r\n>click\r\n</button>\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nIt’s common to do nothing more than setState inside of event handlers for buttons, inputs, and other DOM components. This often makes an inline function the cleanest approach. Instead of bouncing around the file to find the event handlers, they’re colocated. The React community generally welcomes colocation.\r\n\r\nThe button component (and every other DOM component) can’t even be a PureComponent, so there are no shouldComponentUpdate referential identity concerns here.\r\n\r\nSo, the only reason to think this is slow is if you think simply defining a function is a big enough expense to worry about. We’ve discussed that there is no evidence anywhere that it is. It’s simply armchair performance postulation. These are fine until proven otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 2-nd Scenario - A “custom event” or “action”\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<Sidebar\r\n\tonToggle={isOpen => {\r\n\t\tthis.setState({ sidebarIsOpen: isOpen });\r\n\t}}\r\n/>\r\n````\r\n\r\nIf Sidebar is a PureComponent we will be breaking the prop diff. Again, since the handler is simple, the colocation can be preferable.\r\nWith an event like onToggle, why is Sidebar even diffing it? There are only two reasons to include a prop in the shouldComponentUpdate diff:\r\nYou use the prop to render.\r\n\r\nYou use the prop to perform a side-effect in componentWillReceiveProps, componentDidUpdate, or componentWillUpdate.\r\nMost on<whatever> props do not meet either of these requirements. Therefore, most PureComponent usages are over-diffing, forcing developers to maintain referential identity of the handler needlessly.\r\n\r\n#### We should only diff the props that matter. That way people can colocate (inline function execution inside render / return) handlers and still get the performance gains you’re seeking (and since we’re concerned about performance, we’re diffing less!).\r\n\r\n#### Conclusion\r\n\r\nPure Components gives a considerable increase in performance because it reduces the number of render operation in the application which is a huge win for complex UI and therefore advised to use if possible. Also, there will be cases where you want to use the lifecycle methods of Component and in such cases, we cannot use stateless components.\r\n\r\n#### Reading\r\n\r\n1.

It works with Webpack and other bundlers that support both Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and Babel plugins. (see my note in file webpack-Hot-Module-Replacement.md) It is the replacement of code in a running application without requiring a restart or reloading of the application. It is very useful when developing because you can see your changes as you make them thus giving immediate feedback. React hot loading depends on a working Webpack HMR setup\r\n\r\nhttps://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/getstarted/  - This is a good resource to implement HMR (Hot Module Replacement) in React\r\n\r\n# How React Hot Loader works\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader.wiki.git\r\n\r\nReact-Hot-Loader was created to solve 2 tasks:\r\n\r\n- Seamlessly replace the old Components, by the new ones.\r\n- Hide all updates from React, to not let him remount changed branches, and thus drop the information stored in component instances, e.g state.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these goals React-Hot-Loader\r\n\r\n- first detects which \"old\" components shall be replaced by which new ones.\r\n- swaps the real code \"behind\" the components.\r\n\r\nHot module replacement, enchanted with React-hot-loader, might look like a awesome concept, helping you to build application faster, and better, but, according to some, it also has some drawback like A) Compilation is not so “hot”. It may took a minute to build a bundle or B) It empowers monkey-patching, not the tests first approach.\r\n\r\n# How to turn on Hot Module Replacement in create-react-app without ejecting\r\n\r\n### While implementing the react-hot-loader without ejecting create-react-app I have followed []this guide](https://daveceddia.com/hot-reloading-create-react-app/)\r\n\r\nAnd my [live app here-a boilterplate basic counter with react and redux](https://github.com/rohan-paul/redux-boilerplate-base-counter/tree/master/redux-boilerplate-base-counter-without-ejecting)\r\n\r\nFollowed this guide to implement  - https://daveceddia.com/hot-reloading-create-react-app/\r\n\r\n#### Create React App don’t have Hot Module Replacement (HMR) set up by default. HMR allows us to replace modules in-place without restarting the server.\r\n\r\nInstall the following 3 packages\r\n\r\n``yarn add react-app-rewired react-app-rewire-hot-loader react-hot-loader``\r\n\r\nCreate a file called config-overrides.js in the root directory of your project (not under “src”) with this code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst rewireReactHotLoader = require('react-app-rewire-hot-loader');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = function override(config, env) {\r\n  config = rewireReactHotLoader(config, env);\r\n  return config;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nChange index.js accordingly:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport './index.css';\r\nimport App from './App';\r\nimport registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';\r\n\r\n// Add this import:\r\nimport { AppContainer } from 'react-hot-loader';\r\n\r\n// Wrap the rendering in a function:\r\nconst render = Component => {\r\n  ReactDOM.render(\r\n    // Wrap App inside AppContainer\r\n    <AppContainer>\r\n      <App />\r\n    </AppContainer>,\r\n    document.getElementById('root')\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Do this once\r\nregisterServiceWorker();\r\n\r\n// Render once\r\nrender(App);\r\n\r\n// Webpack Hot Module Replacement API\r\nif (module.hot) {\r\n  module.hot.accept('./App', () => {\r\n    render(App);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Change package.json to use react-app-rewired instead of react-scripts.

Under the hood it’s what’s keeping track of session history for React Router.\r\nWhen a component is rendered by React Router, that component is passed three different props: location, match, and history. This history prop comes from the History library and has a ton of fancy properties on it related to routing. In this case, the one we’re interested is history.push. What it does is it pushes a new entry onto the history stack - **aka redirecting the user to another route**.\r\n\r\nMost obvious implementation will be in a handleClick or onSubmit - after clicking / submitting I wanto the user to get redirected to a new URL and also simultaneously add this page to browser history\r\n\r\n## react-router Redirect vs history.push\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/48619733/react-router-redirect-vs-history-push\r\n\r\n### Redirect\r\n\r\nRendering a <Redirect> will navigate to a new location.

The major reason to use Redirect over history.push is that Redirect is future proofed from possible changes on how history would work or if they decide to handle context differently at a later date.\r\n"

SO DONT USE THIS \"--allow-file-access-from-files\" flag IN CHROME**\r\n\r\n## Best solution to above to serve those local .html file is by running a  little http server locally as [suggested in this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18586921/how-to-launch-html-using-chrome-at-allow-file-access-from-files-mode).\r\n\r\n\r\n## --- For Windows / Linux ---\r\n\r\nThe easiest is to install http-server globally using node's package manager:\r\n\r\n``npm install -g http-server``\r\n\r\nThen simply run ``http-server`` in the project root directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEg. d:\\my_project> http-server\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting up http-server, serving ./\r\nAvailable on:\r\n http:169.254.116.232:8080\r\n http:192.168.88.1:8080\r\n http:192.168.0.7:8080\r\n http:127.0.0.1:8080\r\nHit CTRL-C to stop the server\r\n\r\nOr you can also install Python under windows, and follow the instructions below.\r\n\r\n## --- For Linux ---\r\n\r\nSince Python is usually available in most linux distributions, just run ``python -m SimpleHTTPServer`` in your project directory, and you can load your page on http://localhost:8000\r\n\r\nIn Python 3 the SimpleHTTPServer module has been merged into http.server, so the new command is ``python3 -m http.server`` .\r\n\r\nIf there's an index.html file in that directory the the server will by default run that, and if the .html file name is something else, then the server will show in browser the list of files in that directory.\r\n\r\nEasy, and no security risk of accidentally leaving the browser open vulnerable."

        "content": "## What happens when you call setState?\r\n\r\nThe first thing React will do when setState is called is merge the object you passed into setState into the current state of the component. This will kick off a process called reconciliation. The end goal of reconciliation is to, in the most efficient way possible, update the UI based on this new state. To do this, React will construct a new tree of React elements (which you can think of as an object representation of your UI). Once it has this tree, in order to figure out how the UI should change in response to the new state, React will diff this new tree against the previous element tree. By doing this, React will then know the exact changes which occurred, and by knowing exactly what changes occurred, will able to minimize its footprint on the UI by only making updates where absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n## ReactJS uses observable’s to find the modified components. Whenever setState() method is called on any component, ReactJS makes that component dirty and re-renders it.\r\n\r\n[https://hackernoon.com/virtual-dom-in-reactjs-43a3fdb1d130](https://hackernoon.com/virtual-dom-in-reactjs-43a3fdb1d130)\r\n\r\nWhenever setState() method is called, ReactJS creates the whole Virtual DOM from scratch. Creating a whole tree is very fast so it does not affect the performance. At any given time, ReactJS maintains two virtual DOM, one with the updated state Virtual DOM and other with the previous state Virtual DOM.\r\n\r\nReactJS using diff algorithm compares both the Virtual DOM to find the minimum number of steps to update the Real DOM.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't worry too much about calling renders excessively until you have determined you have a performance problem.\r\n\r\n#### Rendering (in the React context) and committing the virtual DOM updates to the real DOM are different matters. The rendering here is referring to generating virtual DOMs, and not about updating the browser DOM. React may batch the setState calls and update the browser DOM with the final new state.\r\n\r\n#### Beside the above, note, setState() is that it is an asynchronous method,\r\n\r\nAsynchronous meaning it returns before actually setting the state. As such, it’s advised against relying on the state to have changed immediately after invoking setState . For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass SomeForm extends React.Component {\r\n  handleFirstNameChange = event => {\r\n    this.setState({ firstName: event.currentTarget.value });\r\n    console.log(this.state.firstName);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <input\r\n          onChange={this.handleFirstnameChange}\r\n          value={this.state.firstName}\r\n        />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we type values into the input field, the console log won’t actually print out the new characters we type.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nBecause of its asynchronous nature, setState accepts a second argument that is a function that it invokes after the state has been updated. So the above example would work if we rewrote handleFirstNameChange as\r\n\r\nhandleFirstNameChange = (event) => {\r\n  this.setState({firstName: event.currentTarget.value}, () => {\r\n    console.log(this.state.firstName);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n"

        "content": "## What is state?\r\n\r\nState is used internally by components to dynamically change data. Unlike props, state can only be set within the component itself. Unlike props, state is a private feature and it strictly belongs to a single Component.\r\n\r\n#### State cannot be accessed and modified outside of the component and only can be used & modified inside the component. Props, on the other hand,make components reusable by giving components the ability to receive data from the parent component in the form of props.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nclass Header extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <p>Welcome back, {this.props.firstName}</p>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    super();\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      firstName: \"Eric\"\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <Header firstName={this.state.firstName} />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is very similar to the first example with just a few minor differences. Notice how our main App class now defines a constructor() function. Note that we must call super since this is an ES6 subclass.\r\n\r\nNotice how we define a this.state object with a firstName property. Instead of passing a hard coded value to the <Header /> component, we pass {this.state.firstName}. While our Header class still references this.props, the property value is being set by a state property.\r\n\r\n### The difference between state and props\r\n\r\nYou may be asking yourself, \"Why both?\". After all, they both pass data to child components.\r\n\r\n### Immutability\r\n\r\nA key difference between state and props is that props are read-only. You can't change the value of a property from within the component itself. Properties are externally passed into components as configuration values and read within the components themselves.\r\n\r\nState is the opposite. The state object is defined internally and can change over time. Using the setState() method, you can change the state object to dynamically update React components:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nclass Header extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <p>Welcome back, {this.props.firstName}</p>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    super();\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      firstName: \"Eric\"\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  updateState() {\r\n    this.setState({\r\n      firstName: \"Fred\"\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <Header firstName={this.state.firstName} />\r\n        <button onClick={this.updateState.bind(this)}>Update name</button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuilding off our same example, you'll notice we've added an updateState() wrapper function that calls this.setState(). When setState() fires, React redraws the component with the registered state changes.\r\n\r\nNotice how the main App class now returns a <button /> element. We've added an onClick() event which fires updateState() via this.updateState.bind(this). Please note that we must bind this to the function so it has the appropriate context.\r\n\r\nIf you run the example, you'll notice the name updates to Fred after clicking the button. This demonstrates how state gives you the ability to dynamically update components.\r\n\r\n### Validation\r\n\r\nYou can validate props. You can't validate state.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\";\r\n\r\nclass Header extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <p>Welcome back, {this.props.firstName}</p>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <Header firstName={this.props.firstName} />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nApp.propTypes = {\r\n  firstName: PropTypes.string.isRequired\r\n};\r\n\r\nApp.defaultProps = {\r\n  firstName: \"Eric\"\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above example demonstrates how to implement validation with properties. Notice the App.propTypes and App.defaultProps have been added to validate props and set default values\r\n\r\n### Accessibility\r\n\r\nRemember that you externally define props and internally use state. While props are immutable values that you pass into components, state is defined internally by components.\r\n\r\n### You can indirectly update a parent's state from within a child component:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nclass Header extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <p>Welcome back, {this.props.firstName}</p>\r\n        <button onClick={this.props.updateName}>Update name!</button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    super();\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      firstName: \"Eric\"\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  updateState() {\r\n    this.setState({\r\n      firstName: \"Fred\"\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <Header\r\n          updateName={this.updateState.bind(this)}\r\n          firstName={this.state.firstName}\r\n        />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### We've changed a few things up in this example. Notice how we pass the updateState() function as a prop via updateName. We then call updateState() directly within the child component. Notice how the <button /> tag has been added under the child component's return() function.\r\n\r\n## When to use state vs props\r\n\r\n1 - The last example is important because it demonstrates the proper use of state. You want to minimize the number of \"stateful\" components you have. By defining state at a root level and propagating data changes downward via props, you keep components consistent with data changes. This facilitates unidirectional data flow and makes React components easy to test.\r\n\r\n#### 2 - Props vs. state comes down to \"who owns this data?\"\r\n\r\nIf data is managed by one component, but another component needs access to that data, you'd pass the data from the one component to the other component via props.\r\n\r\nIf a component manages the data itself, it should use state and setState to manage it.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nState and props are used together to control data flow with React components. While props are used to pass immutable data to child elements, state allows components to dynamically update and propagate changes in a unidirectional pattern.\r\n"

Again, since this is a function, there is no 'this' keyword so just use props.children\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Picture = props => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <img src={props.src} />\r\n            {props.children}\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n// App.js\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction App () {\r\n    render() {\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className='container'>\r\n            <Picture key={PIcture.id} src={picture.src} >\r\n                // whatever is placed here is passed as props.children\r\n                // Like I can place a <div></div> here and it will be rendered as a child to the Picture component.\r\n                // Note, I am not including this extra divs in the Picture componet, but here in App component, where I am calling the picture component.\r\n            </Picture>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou might want to assume that App.js will render as its html within the App.js, but it’s already in another component Picture. It won’t render whatever goes in between in the App.js. UNLESS OFCOURSE I PUT {props.children} inside the Picture component itself\r\n\r\nAnything inside the <Picture> JSX tag in the App component gets passed into the Picutre component as a children.prop. Since Picture renders {props.children} inside a <div>, the passed elements appear in the final output.\r\n\r\nThis de-couples the <Picture> component from its content and makes it more reusable, because I will put the children when the Picture component renders inside a parent component, and not when its defined.\r\n\r\nSo basically I take code out of <Picture> component and put them just-in-time, within <Picture> when this component itself is being called or rendered.

        "content": "### Simple ans to why React app load faster is - its Because of virtual DOM.\r\n\r\nThe virtual DOM is a tree based on JavaScript objects created with React that resembles a DOM tree. Each time you need to change something in the DOM, React employs a different algorithm that exclusively re-renders the DOM nodes that have changed. Meaning, React allows developers to write code as if the entire page is rendered on each change while in the underhood React ONLY renders sub-components that have actually changed.\r\n\r\n### What is DOM rendering\r\n\r\nThe basic task we're talking about is taking the internal state of the program and mapping it to something visible on the screen. You take an assortment of objects, arrays, strings, and numbers and end up with a tree of text paragraphs, forms, links, buttons, and images. On the web, the former is usually represented as JavaScript data structures, and the latter as the Document Object Model\r\n\r\nWe often call this process rendering, and you can think of it as a projection of your data model to a visible user interface. When you render a template with your data, you get a DOM (or HTML) representation of that data.\r\n\r\n[http://teropa.info/blog/2015/03/02/change-and-its-detection-in-javascript-frameworks.html](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/03/02/change-and-its-detection-in-javascript-frameworks.html)\r\n\r\n## How normal DOM (without React) works\r\n\r\n##### 1> [https://medium.com/@gethylgeorge/how-virtual-dom-and-diffing-works-in-react-6fc805f9f84e](https://medium.com/@gethylgeorge/how-virtual-dom-and-diffing-works-in-react-6fc805f9f84e)\r\n\r\n[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Introduction_to_Layout_in_Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Introduction_to_Layout_in_Mozilla)\r\n\r\nSince DOM is represented as a tree structure, and changes to the DOM is pretty quick but the changed element, and it’s children’s has to go through Reflow/Layout stage and then the changes has to be Re-painted which are slow. Therefore more the items to reflow/repaint, more slow your app becomes.\r\n\r\n### 2> What Virtual-DOM does is, it tries to minimize these two stages, and thereby getting a better performance for a big complex app.\r\n\r\n[https://hackernoon.com/virtual-dom-in-reactjs-43a3fdb1d130](https://hackernoon.com/virtual-dom-in-reactjs-43a3fdb1d130)\r\n\r\nRendering engines which is responsible for displaying or rendering the webpage on the browser screen parses the HTML page to create DOM. It also parses the CSS and applies the CSS to the HTML creating a render tree, this process is called as attachment.\r\n\r\nLayout process give exact co-ordinates to each node of the render tree, where the node gets painted and displayed.\r\n\r\nSo when we do,\r\n\r\n`document.getElementById('elementId').innerHTML = \"New Value\"`\r\n\r\nFollowing thing happens:\r\n\r\nBrowser have to parses the HTML\r\n\r\nIt removes the child element of elementId\r\n\r\nUpdates the DOM with the “New Value”\r\n\r\nRe-calculate the CSS for the parent and child\r\n\r\nUpdate the layout i.e. each elements exact co-ordinates on the screen\r\n\r\nTraverse the render tree and paint it on the browser display\r\n\r\nRecalculating the CSS and changed layouts uses complex algorithm and they effect the performance.\r\n\r\nThus updating a Real DOM does not involves just updating the DOM but, it involves a lot of other process.\r\n\r\nAlso, each of the above steps runs for each update of the real DOM i.e. if we update the Real DOM 10 times each of the above step will repeat 10 times. This is why updating Real DOM is slow.\r\n\r\n### Server-Side Rendering: The way it was before React and other libraries\r\n\r\nBefore the era of Big JavaScript, every interaction you had with a web application used to trigger a server roundtrip. Each click and each form submission meant that the webpage unloaded, a request was sent to the server, the server responded with a new page that the browser then rendered.\r\n\r\nWith this approach, there wasn't really any state to manage in the front-end. Each time something happened, that was the end of the universe, as far as the browser was concerned. Whatever state there was, it was a backend concern. The frontend was just some generated HTML and CSS, with perhaps a bit of JavaScript sprinkled on top.\r\n\r\nWhile this was a very simple approach from a front-end perspective, it was also very slow. Not only did each interaction mean a full re-rendering of the UI, it was also a remote re-rendering, with a full roundtrip to a faraway data center.\r\n\r\n[http://teropa.info/blog/2015/03/02/change-and-its-detection-in-javascript-frameworks.html](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/03/02/change-and-its-detection-in-javascript-frameworks.html)\r\n\r\n## [What is virtual DOM?](https://hackernoon.com/virtual-dom-in-reactjs-43a3fdb1d130)\r\n\r\n### Virtual DOM is in-memory representation of Real DOM. It is lightweight JavaScript object which is copy of Real DOM.\r\n\r\nUpdating virtual DOM in ReactJS is faster because ReactJS uses\r\n\r\n- Efficient diff algorithm\r\n- Batched update operations\r\n- Efficient update of sub tree only\r\n- Uses observable instead of dirty checking to detect change\r\n\r\n## ReactJS uses observable’s to find the modified components. Whenever setState() method is called on any component, ReactJS makes that component dirty and re-renders it.\r\n\r\n### Whenever setState() method is called, ReactJS creates the whole Virtual DOM from scratch. Creating a whole tree is very fast so it does not affect the performance.\r\n\r\n### Once you render a JSX element, every single Virtual DOM object gets updated.Compared to updating real DOM objects, the Virtual DOM updates faster. Before updating, a copy of the virtual DOM is made and later compared with the updated Virtual DOM.\r\n\r\n### So at any given time, ReactJS maintains two virtual DOM, one with the updated state Virtual DOM and other with the previous state Virtual DOM. Then React can figure out which objects have been changed, and this process is called Diffing. Once React knows which objects to update, it updates only those objects in the Real DOM.\r\n\r\nReactJS using diff algorithm compares both the Virtual DOM to find the minimum number of steps to update the Real DOM.\r\n\r\nReactJS uses following steps to find the difference in both the Virtual DOM’s\r\n\r\n**1. Re-render all the children if parent state has changed.** If the state of a component has changed, then ReactJS re-renders all the child components even if child components are not modified. To prevent the unwanted re-render of the child components we can use shouldComponentUpdate() component life cycle method. This will further help in boosting the performance.\r\n\r\n**2. Breadth First Search.** ReactJS traverse the tree using BST. Consider the below tree. States of element B and H have changed. So when using BST ReactJS reached element B it will by default re-render the element H. This is the reason to use BST for tree traversal\r\n\r\n<img src=\"BST.jpeg\"/>\r\n\r\n**3. Reconciliation.** It is the process to determine which parts of the Real DOM need to be updated. It follow below steps:\r\n\r\nTwo elements of different types will produce different trees.\r\n\r\n## The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.\r\n\r\n**Virtual DOM is the name React developers gave to their DOM manipulation engine.** Virtual DOM provides a series of Javascript calls that tell the library how to build an in-memory DOM tree and how to update it when data bound to it changes. The central piece of Virtual DOM is its smart diffing algorithm: once the differences in the model have been mapped to the in-memory copy of the DOM, the algorithm finds the minimum number of operations required to update the real DOM. This results in two copies of the in-memory DOM being present during the diffing process.\r\n\r\n## Summing up, updating the browser’s DOM is a three-step process in React.\r\n\r\n- Whenever anything may have changed, the entire UI will be re-rendered in a Virtual DOM representation.\r\n\r\n- The difference between the previous Virtual DOM representation and the new one will be calculated.\r\n\r\n- The real DOM will be updated with what has actually changed. This is very much like applying a patch.\r\n\r\n- Also it uses things like keys in Arrays. Which allow it to have fast array changes in elements.\r\n\r\n## Here are a few reasons why React has become so popular so quickly:\r\n\r\nWorking with the DOM API is hard. React basically gives developers the ability to work with a virtual browser that is more friendly than the real browser. React’s virtual browser acts like an agent between the developer and the real browser.\r\n\r\nReact enables developers to declaratively describe their User Interfaces and model the state of those interfaces. This means instead of coming up with steps to describe transactions on interfaces, developers just describe the interfaces in terms of a final state (like a function). When transactions happen to that state, React takes care of updating the User Interfaces based on that.\r\n\r\n# What is reconciliation\r\n\r\nReact is magical, but it still can’t get around the fact that we must build a DOM for the user to see anything. Building a DOM on every page load is not really faster than old-fashioned HTTP calls right? So how does React avoid replacing the DOM every time a change is made?\r\n\r\n### Before React ever completes the expensive operation of touching the client’s DOM, it does a bit of craft with the “virtual DOM”. Essentially, React holds a version of the DOM in memory, a node-tree with all the elements and their attributes.\r\n\r\n### Whenever a change is made in your application, React takes each element and completes the process of “reconciliation”. At its core, this is just a side-by-side comparison of each component against the version in the virtual DOM. If they are the same, they are left alone. If the component has changed, then it is replaced in the virtual DOM and prepared for insertion into the real DOM. All of this happens incredibly fast.\r\n\r\nAnd once your application begins to change many things at once or deal with large/complex components, you will see that React is a heaven-sent abstraction.\r\n\r\n## When a React UI is rendered for the first time after launching the app, it is first rendered into a virtual DOM, which is not an actual DOM object graph, but a light-weight, pure JavaScript data structure of plain objects and arrays that represents a real DOM object graph. A separate process then takes that virtual DOM structure and creates the corresponding real DOM elements\r\n\r\n## Then, when a change occurs, a new virtual DOM is created from scratch. That new virtual DOM will reflect the new state of the data model. React now has two virtual DOM data structures at hand: The new one and the old one. It then runs a diffing algorithm on the two virtual DOMs, to get the set of changes between them. Those changes, and only those changes, are applied to the real DOM: This element was added, this attribute's value changed, etc.\r\n\r\n[http://teropa.info/blog/2015/03/02/change-and-its-detection-in-javascript-frameworks.html](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/03/02/change-and-its-detection-in-javascript-frameworks.html)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"Virtual-DOM.jpeg\"/>\r\n\r\n### Why Immutable function and Immutable, persistent data-structure is so important in React\r\n\r\nOne approach to controlling changes is to favor immutable, persistent data structures. They seem to be a particularly good fit with React's virtual DOM approach.\r\n\r\nThe thing about immutable data structures is that, as the name implies, you can never mutate one, but only produce new versions of it. If you want to change an object's attribute, you'll need to make a new object with the new attribute, since you can't change the existing one. Because of the way persistent data structures work, this is actually much more efficient than it sounds.\r\n\r\nWhat this means in terms of change detection is that when a React component's state consists of immutable data only, there's an escape hatch: When you're re-rendering a component, and the component's state still points to the same data structure as the last time you rendered it, you can skip re-rendering. You can just use the previous virtual DOM for that component and the whole component tree stemming from it. There's no need to dig in further, since nothing could possibly have changed in the state.\r\n\r\n## Some more Theory on Virtual DOM\r\n\r\nVirtual Dom is javascript object as similar to real DOM. On every mutation triggered either through “setState, dispatcher ” react creates a new virtual tree from scratch by adjusting those changes. React can produce upto 200000 trees in 1 second. In fact, it can produce tree much faster and more efficiently. Creation of new virtual tree follows [Breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) strategy so that changes of any node could be adjusted through parent node if the change has happened on parent node too. If the changes have been done at the root node itself (first root of tree), then react will scrap down the complete tree and create new tree from scratch and also trigger re-rendered for the child components again.\r\n\r\nYou might be wondering that why are we not hitting down the rendering performance, even though it creates virtual tree every time from scratch (in case of only change in parent node) and also trigger the render method of the child components again. Because all these happens without touching the real dom. Real Dom is still far away from the picture.\r\n\r\n[Breadth-first search from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)\r\nBreadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'[1]), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.\r\n\r\nIt uses the opposite strategy as depth-first search, which instead explores the highest-depth nodes first before being forced to backtrack and expand shallower nodes.\r\n\r\n### Batch Update\r\n\r\nReactJS using the diff algorithm to find the minimum number of steps to update the Real DOM. Once it has these steps, it executes all the steps in one event loop without involving the steps to repaint the Real DOM. Thus, if there are more elements which get updated ReactJS will wait for the event loop to finish then, in bulk will updated the real DOM with all the updated elements.\r\n\r\nOnce all the steps are executed, React will repaint the Real DOM. This means during the event loop, there is exactly one time when the Real DOM is being painted. Thus all the layout process will run only one time for updating the real DOM.\r\n\r\n## Good Sources\r\n\r\n- [https://hackernoon.com/virtual-dom-in-reactjs-43a3fdb1d130](https://hackernoon.com/virtual-dom-in-reactjs-43a3fdb1d130)\r\n\r\nMy collection of common JS / React / Node Interview questions, along with answers that I was putting together for myself while preparing for Interviews.

These functions will be linked to your component props by the container’s mapDispatchToProps function. At that point, a component should be able to call a prop like a function and know that it will lead to an action getting dispatched. After the action is dispatched, it will be heard by only one type of function: the reducer.\r\n\r\n### An action is a plain object describing what happened. For example:\r\n\r\n[https://redux.js.org/basics/dataflow](https://redux.js.org/basics/dataflow)\r\n\r\n{ type: 'LIKE_ARTICLE', articleId: 42 }\r\n{ type: 'FETCH_USER_SUCCESS', response: { id: 3, name: 'Mary' } }\r\n{ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Read the Redux docs.' }\r\n\r\nThink of an action as a very brief snippet of news. “Mary liked article 42.” or “‘Read the Redux docs.' was added to the list of todos.”\r\n\r\nCheck my working file -\r\n/home/paul/codes-Lap/React/React-snippets/redux-show-list-of-micro-blog-posts/src/actions/postActions.js\r\n\r\n**action (Object)**: A plain object describing the change that makes sense for your application. Actions are the only way to get data into the store, so any data, whether from the UI events, network callbacks, or other sources such as WebSockets needs to eventually be dispatched as actions. Actions must have a type field that indicates the type of action being performed. Types can be defined as constants and imported from another module. It's better to use strings for type than Symbols because strings are serializable. Other than type, the structure of an action object is really up to you. Other than type, the structure of an action object is really up to you.\r\n\r\nSo from my working file this is an example for post actions\r\n\r\n- /home/paul/codes-Lap/React/React-snippets/redux-show-list-of-micro-blog-posts/src/actions/postActions.js\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { FETCH_POSTS, NEW_POST } from \"./types\";\r\n\r\n// function with ES5 way to dispatch the data to the reducer\r\nexport function fetchPosts() {\r\n  return function(dispatch) {\r\n    fetch(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\")\r\n      .then(res => res.json())\r\n      .then(posts =>\r\n        dispatch({\r\n          type: FETCH_POSTS,\r\n          payload: posts\r\n        })\r\n      );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Object serialization\r\n\r\nObject serialization is the process of converting an object’s state to a string from which it can later be restored. ECMAScript 5 provides native functions JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() to serialize and restore JavaScript objects. These functions use the JSON data interchange format.\r\n\r\nBy convention, the top-level state in React, is an object or some other key-value collection like a Map, but technically it can be any type. Still, you should do your best to keep the state serializable. Don't put anything inside it that you can't easily turn into JSON.\r\n\r\n## Another working example of action dispatching to reducer and updating state\r\n\r\nIn this app, I am getting a list of list items from my store state\r\n\r\n### Note The plain data flows in a typical Redux - dispatch(action) -> reducer -> new state -> re-render\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/rohan-paul/mern-shopping-list/blob/master/client/src/actions/itemActions.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/mern-shopping-list/blob/master/client/src/actions/itemActions.js)\r\n\r\nIn ..actions/itemActions.js I have the below\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const getItems = () => dispatch => {\r\n  dispatch(setItemsLoading()); // because I want the loading to be set to true for now.\r\n\r\n  axios.get(\"/api/items\").then(res => {\r\n    dispatch({\r\n      type: GET_ITEMS,\r\n      payload: res.data\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in ..reducers/itemReducer.js I have -\r\n\r\n```js\r\nswitch(action.type) {\r\n        case GET_ITEMS:\r\n            return {\r\n                ...state,\r\n                items: action.payload,\r\n                loading: false\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, `getItems()` function is the action, and when its invoked or run, then it will dispatch this `action.type`, which is `GET_ITEMS` to the reducers. And then in the reducer I will just return the state ( with spread operator `...state` ), and bring it into my component.\r\n\r\nAnd the way, I invoke this function in my reducer is by doing the `action.type` and then applying various cases. And because of the mechanism of `dispatch` function, when I apply `action.type` and case `GET_ITEM` I return the payload which in this case is the res.data from `getItems()` function dipatching from my action to reducer.\r\n\r\nBy the mechanism of `dispatch()` - I am using dispatch() to send the type along with the data that we get from the axios request to the backend. And note, that the main function getItem() dispatches another function ( setItemsLoading ). This second function is called a thunk, and it returns the object/action. In the context of redux-thunk, a thunk is a second function that performs delayed logic by being asynchronously returned by a first function.\r\n"

It is used to evaluate a JavaScript expression during compilation. A JavaScript expression can be a variable, function, an object, or any code that resolves into a value.\r\n\r\n#### How parenthesis ( {} ) are used?\r\n\r\nParenthesis are used in an arrow function to return an object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n() => ({ name: 'Amanda' })  // Shorthand to return an object\r\n\r\n// The above is equivalent to\r\n\r\n() => {\r\n   return { name : 'Amanda' }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2> [https://stackoverflow.com/a/41461040/1902852](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41461040/1902852)\r\n\r\nFunctional React Component with an argument in curly braces\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst List = ({ items }) => (\r\n  <ul className=\"list\">\r\n    {items.map(item => (\r\n      <ListItem item={item} />\r\n    ))}\r\n  </ul>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is called a \"destructuring\". Actually, you're passing an object as an argument to the function, but the destructuring uses only the named properties of the object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst destructuring = ({ used }) => console.log(used);\r\n\r\nconst properties = {\r\n  unused: 1,\r\n  used: 2\r\n};\r\n\r\ndestructuring(properties); // 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Because of ES-6 official syntax guide - This is true for all arrow functions, not just redux. See below official guide.\r\n\r\n[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#Advanced_Syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#Advanced_Syntax)\r\n\r\n// Parenthesize the body of function to return an object literal expression:\r\n`params => ({foo: bar})`\r\n\r\nThe action creators are functions. Function bodies are enclosed in curly braces. Arrow functions allow you to return immediately instead of using the return keyword by omitting the curly braces that normally surround a function body. However, objects are also surrounded by curly braces.\r\n\r\nSo, in those action creator functions, per ES-6 guide of arrow functions - if you want to return an object you have to use ({..}). If you don't use parentheses and use only the curly ones function sees that like function blocks and can't return an object as intended here.\r\n\r\nIf you leave out the parenthesis, the arrow function believes it is opening and closing the function, as opposed to returning an object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// It believes:\r\n\r\nconst myActionCreator = value => {\r\n  type: \"MY_ACTION\", value;\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Means:\r\n\r\nconst myActionCreator = function(value) {\r\n  type: \"MY_ACTION\", value;\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Instead of:\r\n\r\nconst myActionCreator = function(value) {\r\n  return {\r\n    type: \"MY_ACTION\",\r\n    value\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n\r\n// SO THE CORRECT SYNTAX IS -\r\n\r\nconst myActionCreator = value => ({\r\n  type: \"MY_ACTION\", value;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, you put parenthesis around the curly braces. Now the arrow function knows it is returning what is inside the parenthesis, as opposed to opening the function body. And inside the parenthesis -- your object.\r\n"

A function that does either of those is called a higher order function\r\n\r\nFrom the Redux docs:\r\n\r\nAll compose does is let you write deeply nested function transformations without the rightward drift of the code. Don’t give it too much credit!\r\n\r\nFrom the Redux docs if we don't use compose we would have\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfinalCreateStore = applyMiddleware(middleware)(\r\n      require('redux-devtools').devTools()(\r\n       require('redux-devtools').persistState(window.location.href.match(/[?&]debug_session=([^&]+)\\b/))()\r\n     )\r\n     )(createStore);\r\n```\r\n### Whereas if we use compose\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfinalCreateStore = compose(\r\n    applyMiddleware(...middleware),\r\n    require('redux-devtools').devTools(),\r\n    require('redux-devtools').persistState(\r\n      window.location.href.match(/[?&]debug_session=([^&]+)\\b/)\r\n    )\r\n  )(createStore);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst {\r\n  createStore,\r\n  combineReducers,\r\n  compose,\r\n  bindActionCreators,\r\n  applyMiddleware\r\n} = Redux;\r\n\r\nconst makeLouder = string => string.toUpperCase();\r\nconst repeatThreeTimes = string => string.repeat(3);\r\nconst embolden = string => string.bold();\r\n\r\nconst composeAllThreeFromRightToLeft = compose(makeLouder, embolden, repeatThreeTimes);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ncomposeAllThreeFromRightToLeft('Hello!') will output \"<B>HELLO!HELLO!HELLO!</B>\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compose another example - Here is a very simple example of a function that composes two functions to return a new specialized function:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar greet = function(x) { return `Hello, ${ x }` };\r\nvar emote = function(x) { return `${x} :)` };\r\n\r\nvar compose = function(f, g) {\r\n  return function(x) {\r\n    return f(g(x));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar happyGreeting = compose(greet, emote);\r\nconsole.log(happyGreeting(\"Mark\"));  // => \"Mark\"\r\n\r\n```"

The first argument to connect is mapStateToProps() function.\r\n\r\n## What mapStateToProps() does is, it allows us to take our state (e.g. item state (from itemReducer.js in the below project ) ) and turn this into a component property so I can use it in this component - like e.g. this.props.items\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/rohan-paul/mern-shopping-list/blob/master/client/src/components/ShoppingList.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/mern-shopping-list/blob/master/client/src/components/ShoppingList.js)\r\n\r\nIf this argument is specified, the new component will subscribe to Redux store updates. This means that any time the store is updated, mapStateToProps will be called. The results of mapStateToProps must be a plain object, which will be merged into the component’s props. If you don't want to subscribe to store updates, pass null or undefined in place of mapStateToProps.\r\n\r\nIf your mapStateToProps function is declared as taking two parameters, it will be called with the store state as the first parameter and the props passed to the connected component as the second parameter, and will also be re-invoked whenever the connected component receives new props as determined by shallow equality comparisons. (The second parameter is normally referred to as ownProps by convention.)\r\n\r\n## B> https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2017/03/31/react-redux-connect-explained/\r\n\r\nTo change data, we need to dispatch an action\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when we want to retrieve data, we do not get it directly from the store. Instead, we get a snapshot of the data in the store at any point in time using store.getState() , which gives us the “state” of the application as on the time at which we called the getState method.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what connect does. It maps the stores state and dispatch to the props of a component :\r\n\r\n### mapStateToProps() is a utility which helps your component get updated state(which is updated by some other components),\r\n\r\n### mapDispatchToProps() is a utility which will help your component to fire an action event (dispatching action which may cause change of application state)\r\n\r\n**mapStateToProps** and **mapDispatchToProps** are both pure functions that are provided the stores “state” and “dispatch” respectively. Furthermore, both functions have to return an object, whose keys will then be passed on as the props of the component they are connected to.\r\n\r\nNote: you can't use mapStateToProps for the same purpose as mapDispatchToProps for the basic reason that you don't have access to dispatch inside mapStateToProp. So you couldn't use mapStateToProps to give the wrapped component a method that uses dispatch.\r\n\r\n### mapStateToProps receives the state and props and allows you to extract props from the state to pass to the component.\r\n\r\n### mapDispatchToProps receives dispatch and props and is meant for you to bind action creators to dispatch so when you execute the resulting function the action gets dispatched.\r\n\r\n**mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps** are separate for a good reason, consider the performance: mapStateToProps is actually run several times when state changes, and mapDispatchToProps once (or way fewer anyway than mapStateToProps) it doesn't depend on the state.\r\n\r\nNow take a look at the example - https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2017/03/31/react-redux-connect-explained/\r\n\r\nIn this case, mapStateToProps returns an object with only one key : “todo”, and mapDispatchToProps returns an object with the destroyTodo key.\r\n\r\nThe connected component (which is exported) provides todo and destroyTodo as props to TodoItem.\r\n\r\nwhat mapStateToProps() does in the above example is, it allows us to take our todo state and turn this into a component property so I can use it in this component - like e.g this.props.todo\r\n\r\n## C> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38202572\r\n\r\n### The return value of mapStateToProps() will be an object derived from state (as it lives in the store), whose keys will be passed to your target component (the component connect is applied to) as props. This means that the state as consumed by your target component can have a wildly different structure from the state as it is stored on your store.\r\n\r\n### It's called \"connecting\" your component or \"making it smart\". It's by design. It allows you to decouple your component from your state an additional time which increases the modularity of your code. It also allows you to simplify your component state as a subset of your application state which, in fact, helps you comply with the redux pattern. Think about it this way: a store is supposed to contain the entire text of your application. For large applications, this could contain dozens of properties nested many layers deep. You don't want to haul all that around on each call (expensive).\r\n\r\n### mapStateToProps() has the Store state as an argument and its used to link the component with certain part of the store state\r\n\r\n### By linking I mean the object returned by mapStateToProps will be provided at construction time as props and any subsequent change will be available through componentWillReceiveProps.\r\n\r\n### D) mapDispatchToProps() function - We can remove all reference to our store from our component via the mapDispatchToProps() function. We saw that mapDispatchToProps() allows us to bring in actions, combine them with dispatch and connect events on our page to actions in our store.\r\n\r\nhttps://learn.co/lessons/map-dispatch-to-props-readme\r\n"

A container does data fetching and then renders its corresponding sub-component.\r\n\r\nThe container component that knows about redux and dispatch and store and state.\r\n\r\nThe wrapped-component (i.e. which is not a container) in the pattern, which does the rendering doesn't need to know about any of that stuff: it gets its method to call via its props.\r\n\r\nAnd ... mapDispatchToProps was the useful means that redux provides to let the container-component easily pass that function into the wrapped component on its props.\r\n\r\nThe Container is a file that corresponds directly to a single component. **Think of it like a literal container that you put your component in to ‘upgrade’ it.** By using two container functions called `mapDispatchToProps` and `mapStateToProps`, you can now link up your component’s props to state and action dispatchers (which are used to change state). If you had a div in your component that you want to display a property of state, you can simply make that div display a prop and then use mapStateToProps to link up that prop to state. If you want your component to store something in state, you can create a prop, call it as a function, and then use mapDispatchToProps to dispatch an action.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/@holtkam2/react-redux-understanding-the-data-flow-fd700b6bd56f](https://medium.com/@holtkam2/react-redux-understanding-the-data-flow-fd700b6bd56f)\r\n"

        "content": "<https://redux.js.org/api-reference/store#dispatch>\r\n\r\ndispatch() is one of the 4 methods of redux-store. dispatch() is the method used to dispatch actions and trigger state changes to the store. `react-redux` is simply trying to give you convenient access to it. So the way we take `actions` to the `store` is `dispatch`\r\n\r\n```\r\n​getState()​\r\n\r\n​dispatch(action)​\r\n\r\n​subscribe(listener)​\r\n\r\n​replaceReducer(nextReducer)​\r\n```\r\n\r\n## dispatch(action)​\r\n\r\nDispatches an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change.\r\n\r\nThe store's reducing function will be called with the current getState() result and the given action synchronously. Its return value will be considered the next state. It will be returned from getState() from now on, and the change listeners will immediately be notified.\r\n\r\nArguments\r\naction (Object): A plain object describing the change that makes sense for your application. Actions are the only way to get data into the store, so any data, whether from the UI events, network callbacks, or other sources such as WebSockets needs to eventually be dispatched as actions. Actions must have a type field that indicates the type of action being performed. Types can be defined as constants and imported from another module. It's better to use strings for type than Symbols because strings are serializable. Other than type, the structure of an action object is really up to you.\r\n\r\nReturns\r\n(Object): The dispatched action.\r\n\r\n## Object serialization\r\n\r\nObject serialization is the process of converting an object’s state to a string from which it can later be restored. ECMAScript-5 provides native functions JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() to serialize and restore JavaScript objects. These functions use the JSON data interchange format.\r\n\r\n### My working example - ../brad-mern-shopping-list-Redux-No-Edit-Functionality/client/src/actions/itemActions.js\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport axios from 'axios';\r\nimport { GET_ITEMS, ADD_ITEM, DELETE_ITEM, ITEMS_LOADING } from './types';\r\n\r\nexport const getItems = () => dispatch => {\r\n\r\n    dispatch(setItemsLoading());\r\n\r\n    axios.get('/api/items').then(res => {\r\n        dispatch({\r\n            type: GET_ITEMS,\r\n            payload: res.data\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n\r\n......\r\n\r\nexport const setItemsLoading = item => {\r\n    return {\r\n        type: ITEMS_LOADING\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, **getItems**() function is the action, and when its invoked or run, then it will dispatch this action type, which is '**GET_ITEMS**' to the reducers. And then in the reducer I will just return the state ( with spread operator ...state), and bring it into my component. And the way, I invoke this function in my reducer is by doing the `action.type` and then applying various cases. And because of the mechanism of `dispatch` function, when I apply `action.type` and case `GET_ITEM` I dispatch `getItems()` function from my action to reducer.\r\n\r\n**The mechanism of dispatch()** - First I am sending an axios.get request to get the data. Then, I am using dispatch() to send the type along with the data that we get from the axios request to the backend. The main function (**getItem()**) dispatches another function ( **setItemsLoading** ). This second function is called a **thunk**, and it returns the object/action. In the context of redux-thunk, a thunk is a second function that performs delayed logic by being asynchronously returned by a first function.\r\n\r\nThis double function strategy allows us to wait for an asynchronous operation (like fetching data) to complete, and then the action is returned by the thunk.\r\n\r\nThe plain data flows in a typical Redux is like this >>> dispatch(action) -> reducer -> new state -> re-render\r\n\r\nThe adjusted order, including reducers, is: dispatch ➡️ action creator ➡️ thunk ➡️ action ➡️ reducer.\r\n\r\n### Note the pattern is one of function currying - i.e. one function returning another function while taking single or no argument\r\n\r\n### Why is Redux passing dispatch into the return function of an action?\r\n\r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47485100/why-is-redux-passing-dispatch-into-the-return-function-of-an-action](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47485100/why-is-redux-passing-dispatch-into-the-return-function-of-an-action)\r\nIts not returning the dispatch , its actually sending dispatch to a anonymous function where that actions will happen.\r\n\r\nThis pattern is an example for asynchronous actions using Redux-thunk. If you look at this middleware it checks if your action is a function and if it is, it will pass dispatch to your returned function. **You cannot just call an action in redux, you always have to dispatch it, so you should use dispatch object to call your action.**\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk/blob/master/src/index.js](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk/blob/master/src/index.js)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction createThunkMiddleware(extraArgument) {\r\n  return ({ dispatch, getState }) => next => action => {\r\n    if (typeof action === \"function\") {\r\n      return action(dispatch, getState, extraArgument);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return next(action);\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n"

Flux is a fancy name for the observer pattern modified a little bit to fit React.\r\n\r\nBoth Flux and Redux have actions. Actions can be compared to events (or what trigger events). In Flux, an action is a simple JavaScript object, and that’s the default case in Redux too, but when using Redux middleware, actions can also be functions and promises.\r\n\r\nWith Flux it is a convention to have multiple stores per application; each store is a singleton object. In Redux, the convention is to have a single store per application, usually separated into data domains internally (you can create more than one Redux store if needed for more complex scenarios).\r\n\r\nFlux has a single dispatcher and all actions have to pass through that dispatcher. It’s a singleton object. A Flux application cannot have multiple dispatchers. This is needed because a Flux application can have multiple stores and the dependencies between those stores need a single manager, which is the dispatcher.\r\n\r\nRedux has no dispatcher entity. Instead, the store has the dispatching process baked in. A Redux store exposes a few simple API functions, one of them is to dispatch actions.\r\n\r\nIn Flux, the logic of what to do on the data based on the received action is written in the store itself. The store also has the flexibility of what parts of the data to expose publicly. The smartest player in a Flux app is the store.\r\n\r\nIn Redux, the logic of what to do on the data based on the received actions is in the reducer function that gets called for every action that gets dispatched (through the store API). A store can’t be defined without a reducer function. A Redux reducer is a simple function that receives the previous state and one action, and it returns the new state based on that action. In a Redux app, you can split your reducer into simpler functions as you would do with any other function. The smartest player in Redux is the reducer."

The only place they are supposed to get information from is their props.\r\n\r\nSeparated from \"displaying stuff\" (components) is:\r\n\r\n#### how you get the stuff to display,\r\n\r\n#### and how you handle events.\r\n\r\n#### That is what containers are for.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a \"well-designed\" component in the pattern look like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass FancyAlerter extends Component {\r\n  sendAlert = () => {\r\n    this.props.sendTheAlert();\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h1>Today's Fancy Alert is {this.props.fancyInfo}</h1>\r\n      <Button onClick={sendAlert} />\r\n    </div>;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee how this component gets the info it displays from props (which came from the redux store via `mapStateToProps`) and it also gets its action function from its props: `sendTheAlert()`.\r\n\r\nThat's where `mapDispatchToProps` comes in: in the corresponding container\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// FancyButtonContainer.js\r\n\r\nfunction mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {\r\n    return({\r\n        sendTheAlert: () => {dispatch(ALERT_ACTION)}\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction mapStateToProps(state} {\r\n    return({fancyInfo: \"Fancy this:\" + state.currentFunnyString})\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const FancyButtonContainer = connect(\r\n    mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(\r\n    FancyAlerter\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow that it's the container that knows about redux and dispatch and store and state and ... stuff.\r\n\r\nThe component in the pattern, FancyAlerter, which does the rendering doesn't need to know about any of that stuff: it gets its method to call at onClick of the button, via its props.\r\n\r\nAnd ... mapDispatchToProps was the useful means that redux provides to let the container easily pass that function into the wrapped component on its props.\r\n\r\nAll this looks very like the todo example in docs, and another answer here, but I have tried to cast it in the light of the pattern to emphasize why.\r\n\r\n(Note: you can't use mapStateToProps for the same purpose as mapDispatchToProps for the basic reason that you don't have access to dispatch inside mapStateToProp.

        "content": "All `mapStateToProps()` does is, it takes a piece from the App's single state-tree i.e. the **store** and turn this into a component prop, so I can use it in this current component as a regular prop.\r\n\r\nLet’s see a basic example: you have two components, `DisplayHello` and `DisplayQuestion`. They both need to access the same info, the **nickname** of our user. The basic way (without using `redux` and `mapStateToProps` ) to do that is to propagate props from the root of your app (which maintains a state) as below:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// App.js:\r\n\r\nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\r\nimport DisplayHello from \"./DisplayHello\";\r\nimport DisplayQuestion from \"./DisplayQuestion\";\r\n\r\nclass App extends Component {\r\n    state = {\r\n        username: 'ovrsea',\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                <DisplayHello username={this.state.username}/>\r\n                <DisplayQuestion username={this.state.username}/>\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nexport default App;\r\n\r\n// Now below is DisplayHello.js:\r\nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass DisplayHello extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <p>\r\n                Hello {this.props.username} !\r\n            </p>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nexport default DisplayHello;\r\n\r\n// And then the DisplayQuestion.js:\r\nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass DisplayQuestion extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                What do you want to order today, {this.props.username} ?\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nexport default DisplayQuestion;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it could become heavy to handle if you have a lot of information and/or components. It is not the role of the root to handle your app data ! This is where HOC are useful. We create a component which “pushes” the info to the components which need them ! How does it work ? It is just a function that takes a component as input and returns the same component with new props. The code of this magic trick is below :\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// The Higher Order Component\r\nimport React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nexport default function ourFirstStore(WrappedComponent) {\r\n    return class extends Component {\r\n        state = {\r\n            username: 'ovrsea',\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        render() {\r\n            return <WrappedComponent username={this.state.username} {...this.props} />;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Then DisplayHello updated version implemented with HOC:\r\nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\r\nimport ourFirstStore from \"./ourFirstStore\";\r\n\r\nclass DisplayHello extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <p>\r\n                Hello {this.props.username} !\r\n            </p>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nexport default ourFirstStore(DisplayHello);\r\n\r\n\r\n// And now the DisplayQuestion updated version implemented with HOC.\r\nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\r\nimport ourFirstStore from \"./ourFirstStore\";\r\n\r\nclass DisplayQuestion extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                What do you want to order today, {this.props.username} ?\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nexport default ourFirstStore(DisplayQuestion);\r\n\r\n\r\n// And the updated App.js now after implementation of the HOC\r\nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\r\nimport DisplayHello from \"./DisplayHello\";\r\nimport DisplayQuestion from \"./DisplayQuestion\";\r\n\r\nclass App extends Component {\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                <DisplayHello/>\r\n                <DisplayQuestion/>\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that all the data is now in the wrapper and not in `App.js` anymore. We just created a very basic data store accessible anywhere in your app !\r\n\r\n### So now instead of the HOC as above implement `mapStateToProps` - to access your my state from store as props for the current component\r\n\r\nThe main issue is: your store might be huge, and your component does not need to be aware of all the changes in it. You want to choose which variables are accessed by which component. This is where mapStateToProps comes into action !\r\n\r\nBasically, this function tells your component what props will be added. You need `state.username` ? Then add it as `state.username` within `mapStateToProps`\r\nYou need the email ? Do the same. The “map” itself is just an object returned by your function.\r\n\r\n#### If our state looks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    username: ‘initial name’\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actually the above state will be coded as below with reducers and combineReducers\r\n\r\n#### 1> So first the state will be held in userReducer.js file like below\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// userNameReducer.js file\r\n\r\nconst initialState = {\r\n  usernames: [],\r\n  loading: false\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default function(state = initialState, action) {\r\n  switch (action.type) {\r\n    case GET_USERNAMES:\r\n      return {\r\n        ...state,\r\n        usernames: action.payload,\r\n        loading: false\r\n      };\r\n    default:\r\n      return state;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the above reducer will be combined along with other reducers in a separate index.js (which index.js file will later be imported as rootReducer in the store.js file of the app ) file within the reducers folder structure as below\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// This is my rootReducer i.e. the index.js file\r\n\r\nimport { combineReducers } from \"redux\";\r\nimport userNameReducer from \"./userNameReducer\";\r\n\r\nexport default combineReducers({\r\n  username: userNameReducer\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe store.js file will then hold the single state-tree of the app as below\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from \"redux\";\r\nimport thunk from \"redux-thunk\";\r\nimport rootReducer from \"./reducers\";\r\n// As I have named my root-reducer as index.js inside ./reducers/ folder, hence no need to mention separately /reducers/index\r\n\r\nconst initialState = {};\r\n\r\n// put any middleware inside an array\r\nconst middleware = [thunk];\r\n\r\n// For the third argument to createStore(), which takes some optional store enhancers, since I am using redux-tools, I want to wrap the applyMiddleware() in this compose() function.\r\n// To apply multiple store enhancers, you may use compose(). - per official doc - https://redux.js.org/api-reference/createstore\r\n\r\nconst store = createStore(\r\n  rootReducer,\r\n  initialState,\r\n  compose(\r\n    applyMiddleware(...middleware),\r\n    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default store;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Then, our final DisPlayQuestion.js component will be as below\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\r\nimport { connect } from \"react-redux\";\r\n\r\nclass DisplayQuestion extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>What do you want to order today, {this.props.nameAsProps} ?</div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction mapStateToProps(state) {\r\n  return {\r\n    nameAsProps: state.username\r\n  };\r\n}\r\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(DisplayQuestion);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe exact similar working version for a shopping-list CRUD app (just like a To-Do app to do all the CRUD operations ) is in here -[https://github.com/rohan-paul/mern-shopping-list/tree/master/client/src/reducers](https://github.com/rohan-paul/mern-shopping-list/tree/master/client/src/reducers)\r\n\r\n### Further Reading\r\n\r\n1> [https://medium.com/ovrsea/mapstatetoprops-and-why-you-may-not-need-mapdispatchtoprops-as-a-beginner-dd012a3da5e6](https://medium.com/ovrsea/mapstatetoprops-and-why-you-may-not-need-mapdispatchtoprops-as-a-beginner-dd012a3da5e6)\r\n"

If you do not wish to subscribe to the store, pass null or undefined to connect in place of mapStateToProps.\r\n\r\n**The state argument of mapStateToProps(state)**\r\n\r\nThe first argument to a mapStateToProps function is the entire Redux store state (the same value returned by a call to store.getState()). Because of this, the first argument is traditionally just called state. We can give the argument any name you want.\r\n\r\nYour mapStateToProps functions are expected to return an object. This object, normally referred to as stateProps, will be merged as props to your connected component. You may define mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps as a factory function, i.e., you return a function instead of an object. In this case your returned function will be treated as the real mapStateToProps or mapDispatchToProps, and be called in subsequent calls.\r\n\r\n### Small note - Because mapStateToProps() take the item state (from itemReducer.js ) and turns this into a component property. So I am applying PropTypes on item `item: PropTypes.object.isRequired`\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/rohan-paul/mern-shopping-list/blob/master/client/src/components/ShoppingList.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/mern-shopping-list/blob/master/client/src/components/ShoppingList.js)\r\n\r\nIn the above project, the itemReducer.js holds all the list of items. And depending on the action dispatched to it, it returns either the list of all items, adds an item to the existing list of items or deletes an item so on and so forth.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nShoppingList.PropTypes = {\r\n  getItems: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\r\n  item: PropTypes.object.isRequired\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhat mapStateToProps() does is, it allows us to take our item state (from itemReducer.js ) and turn this into a component property so I can use it in this ShoppingList component - like e.g. `this.props.items`\r\n\r\nmapStateToProps() has the Store state as an argument and its used to link the component with certain part of the store state . In returned object from mapStateToProps() below, I am using 'item' as key because thats what I am calling it in my rootReducer (./reducers/index.js)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst mapStateToProps = state => ({\r\n  item: state.item\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso in above note, when returning an Object, I will have to wrap it in parentheses. Hence the parenthesis before the curly braces\r\n\r\nAny action that I have brought in at the top here in this component, I have to connect with this component\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default connect(\r\n  mapStateToProps,\r\n  { getItems, deleteItem }\r\n)(ShoppingList);\r\n```\r\n\r\nmapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps are both pure functions that are provided with (or passed to them), the stores “state” and “dispatch” respectively. Furthermore, both functions have to return an object, whose keys will then be passed on as the props of the component they are connected to (ShoppingList in this case).\r\n\r\n#### MOST IMPORTANT POINT (THAT BAFFLED ME INITIALLY) - How dows mapStateToProps know which is this 'item' variable that I am talking about.\r\n\r\n##### And the answer is from the rootReducer (./reducers/index.js) file. There, from combineReducers() functions I am returning all the state that ./itemReducer.js file is returning. by doing this\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { combineReducers } from \"redux\";\r\nimport itemReducer from \"./itemReducer\";\r\n\r\nexport default combineReducers({\r\n  item: itemReducer\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. mapStateToProps - General Syntax - 2nd Example\r\n\r\n`counterValue: PropTypes.number.isRequired`\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/rohan-paul/redux-boilerplate-base-counter/blob/master/redux-boilerplate-base-counter-without-ejecting/src/containers/Home.js](https://github.com/rohan-paul/redux-boilerplate-base-counter/blob/master/redux-boilerplate-base-counter-without-ejecting/src/containers/Home.js)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Home = ({ counterValue, handleIncreaseValue, handleDecreaseValue }) => (\r\n  <div>\r\n    <h2>Home Page</h2>\r\n    <p>The counter value is {counterValue}</p>\r\n    <button onClick={handleIncreaseValue}>Add</button>\r\n    <button onClick={handleDecreaseValue}>Remove</button>\r\n  </div>\r\n);\r\n\r\nHome.propTypes = {\r\n  counterValue: PropTypes.number.isRequired,\r\n  handleIncreaseValue: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\r\n  handleDecreaseValue: PropTypes.func.isRequired\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst mapStateToProps = state => ({\r\n  counterValue: state.counterReducer\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({\r\n  handleIncreaseValue: () => {\r\n    dispatch(actions.addToCounter());\r\n  },\r\n  handleDecreaseValue: () => {\r\n    dispatch(actions.removeFromCounter());\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default connect(\r\n  mapStateToProps,\r\n  mapDispatchToProps\r\n)(Home);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn returned object from `mapStateToProps()` above, I am using `**counterValue**` as key because thats what I am calling it as the props passed to this `Home.js` functional component at the very top when defining this functional component.\r\n\r\n`< const Home = ({ counterValue, handleIncreaseValue, handleDecreaseValue }) =>`\r\n\r\nNote: you can't use `mapStateToProps` for the same purpose as `mapDispatchToProps` for the basic reason that you don't have access to `dispatch` inside `mapStateToProp`. So you couldn't use `mapStateToProps` to give the wrapped component a method that uses `dispatch`.\r\n\r\n### EXPLANATION of `connect()` method and how it takes mapStateToProps() as its first argument.\r\n\r\nTo change data, we need to dispatch an action to store.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when we want to retrieve data, we do not get it directly from the store. Instead, we get a snapshot of the data in the store at any point in time using store.getState() , which gives us the “state” of the application as on the time at which we called the getState() method.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what connect does. It maps the store's state and dispatch to the props of a component :\r\n\r\n**mapStateToProps** and **mapDispatchToProps** are both pure functions that are provided with the (or passed to them), stores “state” and “dispatch” respectively. Furthermore, both functions have to return an object, whose keys will then be passed on as the props of the component they are connected to (ShoppingList in this case).\r\n\r\nIn this case, mapStateToProps returns an object with only one key : “item”.\r\n\r\nThen the connected component (which is exported) provides 'item' as props to ShoppingList component.\r\n\r\nThe return value of mapStateToProps() will be an object derived from state (as it lives in the store), whose keys will be passed to your target component (the component connect is applied to) as props. This means that the state as consumed by your target component can have a wildly different structure from the state as it is stored on your store.\r\n\r\nIt's called \"connecting\" your component or \"making it smart\". It's by design. It allows you to decouple your component from your state an additional time which increases the modularity of your code. It also allows you to simplify your component state as a subset of your application state which, in fact, helps you comply with the redux pattern. Think about it this way: a store is supposed to contain the entire text of your application. For large applications, this could contain dozens of properties nested many layers deep. You don't want to haul all that around on each call (which will become too expensive for the appliaction's overal efficiency ).\r\n\r\n#### How mapStateToProps() determines if component should re-render\r\n\r\n[Official Doc says](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapstate#return-values-determine-if-your-component-re-renders)\r\n\r\nReact Redux internally implements the shouldComponentUpdate method such that the wrapper component re-renders precisely when the data your component needs has changed. By default, React Redux decides whether the contents of the object returned from mapStateToProps are different using === comparison (a \"shallow equality\" check) on each fields of the returned object. If any of the fields have changed, then your component will be re-rendered so it can receive the updated values as props. Note that returning a mutated object of the same reference is a common mistake that can result in your component not re-rendering when expected.\r\n\r\n##### Many common operations result in new object or array references being created:\r\n\r\n- Creating new arrays with someArray.map() or someArray.filter()\r\n- Merging arrays with array.concat\r\n- Selecting portion of an array with array.slice\r\n- Copying values with Object.assign\r\n- Copying values with the spread operator { ...oldState, ...newData }\r\n\r\n### What is Shallow Comparison\r\n\r\n- A> When shallow comparing scalar values (numbers, strings) it compares their values. When comparing objects, it does not compare their attributes - only their references are compared (e.g. \"do they point to same object?).\r\n\r\n- B> Shallow comparison is when the properties of the objects being compared is done using \"===\" or strict equality and will not conduct comparisons deeper into the properties. So if you shallow compare a deep nested object it will just check the reference not the values inside that object.\r\n\r\n- C> shallowCompare performs a shallow equality check on the current props and nextProps objects as well as the current state and nextState objects.\r\n  It does this by iterating on the keys of the objects being compared and returning true when the values of a key in each object are not strictly equal.\r\n\r\n  shallowCompare returns true if the shallow comparison for props or state fails and therefore the component should update.\r\n  shallowCompare returns false if the shallow comparison for props and state both pass and therefore the component does not need to update.\r\n\r\n#### Other Resources\r\n\r\n1> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMUXbkKzW0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMUXbkKzW0)\r\n\r\n2> [Shallow compare official dox](https://reactjs.org/docs/shallow-compare.html)\r\n"

First, the createStore function can take preloadedState as its second argument. This is primarily intended for initializing the store with state that was previously persisted elsewhere, such as the browser's localStorage. The other way is for the root reducer to return the initial state value when the state argument is undefined. These two approaches are described in more detail in Initializing State, but there are some additional concerns to be aware of when using combineReducers.\r\n\r\n**combineReducers takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and creates a function that outputs a corresponding state object with the same keys. This means that if no preloaded state is provided to createStore, the naming of the keys in the input slice reducer object will define the naming of the keys in the output state object.**\r\n"

It serves just one purpose : to “provide” the store to its child components.\r\n\r\nSince the provider only makes the store accessible to it’s children, and we would ideally want our entire app to access the store, the most sensible thing to do would be to put our App component within Provider.\r\n\r\nIf we were to follow the previous diagram, the Provider node would be represented as a parent node on top of the App node. However, because of the utility that Provider gives us, I feel it’s more appropriate to represent it as something which “wraps” the entire application tree.\r\n\r\n2. http://funkyjavascript.com/redux-provider/\r\n\r\nIt's a helper React component that eliminates the need to keep passing along the redux store as a parameter.  So, as per the syntax Provider takes in property of my store, like so store={store}\r\n\r\n```js\r\n.....\r\n    {Provider} = require('react-redux'),\r\n.....\r\n    render = () =>\r\n        ReactDOM.render(\r\n            <Provider store={store}>\r\n                <div>****\r\n                    <TypeyThing/>\r\n                    <ListOfThings/>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </Provider>,\r\n            document.getElementById('root'))\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nProvider can only have one child component so I wrapped my two components TypeyThing and ListOfThings in a div.\r\n\r\n2. http://www.react.express/react_redux\r\n\r\nReact Redux exposes the Provider component to handle passing our store to every container component. We'll generally use this to wrap the root component of our app, e.g. <Provider store={store}> ... </Provider>.\r\n\r\nLike in the below - https://codepen.io/cassiecodes/pen/bZybop\r\n\r\n```js\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  <Provider store={createStore(todoApp)}>\r\n     <TodoApp />\r\n  </Provider>,\r\n  document.getElementById('root')\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-provider-pattern-context/\r\n\r\nBasically, React’s provider pattern takes the clutter away of passing mandatory props, that are needed by every component, down your whole component tree.\r\n\r\nIn Redux or MobX, you often end up with a Provider component at the top of your component hierarchy that bridges your state layer (Redux/MobX/…) to your view layer (React). The Provider component gets the state as props and afterward, each child component has implicitly access to the managed state from the store(s).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  <Provider store={store}>\r\n    <App />\r\n  </Provider>,\r\n  document.getElementById('root')\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Store - https://redux.js.org/basics/store\r\n\r\n## 4. Provider is an HOC Concept - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48227188/how-does-provider-and-connect-work-in-react\r\n\r\nTo be able to understand how Provider and connect work we need to understand 2 concepts in React\r\n\r\n### 1- Context api:\r\n\r\n### Context is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass the props down manually at every level\r\n\r\n### 2- Higher Order Component (HOC):\r\n\r\n### A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component but before returning the new component you can pass extra custom props and then return it,\r\n\r\n5. Provider is an HOC Concept  - https://medium.com/@bloodyowl/the-provider-and-higher-order-component-patterns-with-react-d16ab2d1636\r\nLots of React libraries need to make their data pass through all your component tree. For instance, Redux needs to pass its store and React Router needs to pass the current location. This could possibly seem to be handled using shared mutable state, but it only works on the client, when you have one state. If you prerender on the server, it’s just impossible to rely on such implementation.\r\n\r\nFortunately, React provides a way to pass data from top to bottom: context. You can basically see it as the global object of your component tree. Provider component sets the context for all its children, providing the store in it.\r\n\r\nAt the top of your app, you must therefore have a Provider. Its only role will basically be to add the data you want to the tree’s context, so that all its descendants can have access to it.\r\n\r\n the best way to create a reusable functionality is a Higher-Order Component. This means that we basically wrap the component in another one, whose only role is to grab the functionality and pass it as props. The component you export from your module is the Higher-Order Component, which renders yours."

The function is called in the form of component.\r\n\r\n### The corresponding container dispatches an action. This happens because the prop (which was just called in the container) is tied to an action dispatcher using mapDispatchToProps (in the container).\r\n\r\n(Containers are a gateway between State and Components. They take a piece of State from the Store and pass it into a Component as props using the mapStateToProps() method. The mapStateToProps() method accepts the state and returns only the relevant bits of state we need.)\r\n\r\n### A reducer ‘hears’ that action and runs a function which returns a new state with specific modifications.\r\n\r\n### The container ‘knows’ that state has changed and modifies a specific prop in the component as a result of the mapStateToProps function.\r\n\r\n### The component now has a prop that has officially changed due to a new state being generated, so if that prop is responsible for any any visible UI, the user will see it change automatically.\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9de527b9432cc9244dc600875b46b43311918b59/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f6d656469612d702e736c69642e65732f75706c6f6164732f3336343831322f696d616765732f323438343739302f415243482d5265647578322d657874656e6465642d7265616c2d6465636c657261746976652e676966)\r\n\r\n## An example of How data and state flows in Redux\r\n\r\nBasically in React the `setState()` method is the initial and final step for changing the state and re-rendering the component. But with Redux this state changing will have to go through 5 / 6 different steps before state change can happen.\r\n\r\n**All these because in Redux all the application's state lives in one immutable state-tree called store.**\r\nThat store is at the fundamental level is a simple javascript object. And the reason its called **immutable** is because one does not simply modify the state tree. What we do is, we distribute action. **State is read-only**: The state cannot be changed directly by the view or any other process (maybe as a result of network callback or some other event). In order to change the state, you must express your intent by emitting an action. An action is a plain object describing your intent, and it contains a type property and some other data. Actions can be logged and later replayed which makes it good for debugging and testing purpose.\r\n\r\n### 1> User types in an input box.\r\n\r\n### 2> That calls an action-creator to get a well-formed action. Action-Creator is just a function and creates an object.\r\n\r\nObject goes to the reducer, which in turn is just a function that takes an object. And what comes out of it is also just an object.\r\n\r\n### 3> The action then is dispatched to Redux - Redux then inserts that action to a Root-reducer.\r\n\r\n### 4> The Root-reducer delegates that action to the correct reducer to handle that sort of action.\r\n\r\n### 5> That reducer returns a new state and given the old state and the action object, the new state becomes the stored state.\r\n\r\n### 6> That store then is fed-back into React and calls forth the final updated state.\r\n\r\n#### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/@holtkam2/react-redux-understanding-the-data-flow-fd700b6bd56f](https://medium.com/@holtkam2/react-redux-understanding-the-data-flow-fd700b6bd56f)\r\n"

And then new state of the world comes out as the output of reducers.\r\n\r\n### And how the action object is created - by something called Action creator, which is a function and the purpose of which is to create objects. So Action Creators creates objects -> Objects goes to Reducers (which is just a function) -> And ultimately what comes out, is the new state which is just an object.\r\n\r\n### The Action Creator.\r\n\r\nIn this file, you will write the functions that dispatch an action. These functions will be linked to your component props by the container’s mapDispatchToProps function. At that point, a component should be able to call a prop like a function and know that it will lead to an action getting dispatched. After the action is dispatched, it will be heard by only one type of function: the reducer.\r\n\r\nThe Reducer is the last step of the process of user-input generating a state-change and rendering the changed state back to the view. After ‘hearing’ an action get dispatched, the reducer can now generate a new state based on what the action wants it to do. Note the the state never actually changes in Redux, but instead the reducer generates a new state which is a copy of the old state, but with some sort of modification.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"reducers.svg\">\r\n\r\n1> https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers\r\n\r\nReducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. Remember that actions only describe what happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes.\r\n\r\nThe reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.\r\n\r\n## (previousState, action) => newState\r\n\r\nIt's called a reducer because it's the type of function you would pass to Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue). It's very important that the reducer stays pure. Things you should never do inside a reducer:\r\n\r\nMutate its arguments;\r\n\r\nPerform side effects like API calls and routing transitions;\r\n\r\nCall non-pure functions, e.g. Date.now() or Math.random().\r\n\r\nFor now, just remember that the reducer must be pure. Given the same arguments, it should calculate the next state and return it. No surprises. No side effects. No API calls. No mutations. Just a calculation.\r\n\r\n2> https://daveceddia.com/what-is-a-reducer/\r\n\r\nRedux is basically a fancy `Array.reduce` function. A Redux reducer function has this signature:\r\n\r\n## (state, action) => newState\r\n\r\nAs in: it takes the current state, and an action, and returns the newState. Looks a lot like the signature of an Array.reduce reducer, eh? Remember:\r\n\r\n## (accumulatedValue, nextItem) => nextAccumulatedValue\r\n\r\nPlainly speaking, a Redux reducer gets to decide how each action affects the state.\r\n\r\n## 3> Reducers Must be Pure Functions\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve deterministic state reproduction, reducers must be pure functions. No exceptions. A pure function:\r\n\r\nGiven the same input, always returns the same output.\r\nHas no side-effects.\r\nImportantly in JavaScript, all non-primitive objects are passed into functions as references. In other words, if you pass in an object, and then directly mutate a property on that object, the object changes outside the function as well. That’s a side-effect. You can’t know the full meaning of calling the function without also knowing the full history of the object you passed in. That’s bad.\r\n\r\nReducers should return a new object, instead. You can do that with `Object.assign({}, state, { thingToChange })`, for instance.\r\n\r\nArray parameters are also references. You can’t just `.push()` new items to an array in a reducer, because `.push()` is a mutating operation. Likewise, so are `.pop()`, `.shift()`, `.unshift()`, `.reverse()`, `.splice()`, and any other mutator method.\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-tips-for-better-redux-architecture-69250425af44](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-tips-for-better-redux-architecture-69250425af44)\r\n\r\n## Reducers shouldn't perform any side effects like API calls or router transitions. These should happen before an action is dispatched.\r\n"

A thunk creator, which is an action creator that returns a thunk (a.k.a. asynchronous action creators)\r\n- 2. The thunk itself, which is the function that is returned from the thunk creator and accepts dispatch and setState as arguments\r\n\r\nThe reason that we need to use a middleware such as Redux-Thunk is because the Redux store only supports synchronous data flow. Thus, middleware to the rescue! Middleware allows for asynchronous data flow, interprets anything that you dispatch and finally returns a plain object allowing the synchronous Redux data flow to resume. Redux middleware can thus solve for many critical asynchronous needs (e.g., axios requests).\r\n\r\n### First note that, the synchronous and pure flow of data through Redux’s components is well-defined with distinct, simple roles. Which is as below ->\r\n\r\n### Action creators create objects → objects are dispatched to the store → the store invokes reducers → reducers generate new state → listeners are notified of state updates.\r\n\r\nA thunk is another word for a function. It’s a special (and uncommon) name for a function that’s returned by another. Like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction not_a_thunk() {\r\n  // this one is a \"thunk\" because it defers work for later:\r\n  return function() {\r\n    console.log(\"do stuff now\");\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I want to execute the “do stuff now” part, you have to call it like `not_a_thunk()()` – calling it twice, basically.\r\n\r\nAt its heart, though, Redux is really simple. Actions are just objects – and they are expected to only be objects. They look like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  type: \"USER_LOGGED_IN\",\r\n  username: \"dave\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, since it’s kind of annoying to build objects by hand all the time, Redux has “action creators” that build these things:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction userLoggedIn() {\r\n  return {\r\n    type: \"USER_LOGGED_IN\",\r\n    username: \"dave\"\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame action, but now you can “create” it by calling the userLoggedIn function.\r\n\r\nIsn’t it kind of funny that Redux’s so-called “actions” don’t actually do anything? They’re just objects. Boring and simple and inert.\r\n\r\n### **\\*\\***\\*\\***\\*\\***\\***\\*\\***\\*\\***\\*\\***\r\n\r\nRedux Thunk teaches Redux to recognize special kinds of actions that are in fact functions.\r\n\r\nWhen an action creator returns a function, that function will get executed by the Redux Thunk middleware. This function doesn't need to be pure; it is thus allowed to have side effects, including executing asynchronous API calls. The function can also dispatch actions.\r\n\r\nThe thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met.\r\n\r\nIf Redux Thunk middleware is enabled, any time you attempt to dispatch a function instead of an action object, the middleware will call that function with dispatch method itself as the first argument.\r\n\r\nAnd then since we “taught” Redux to recognize such “special” action creators (we call them thunk action creators), we can now use them in any place where we would use regular action creators.\r\n\r\n### **\\*\\***\\*\\*\\*\\***\\*\\***\\*\\*\\*\\***\\*\\***\\*\\*\\*\\***\\*\\***\r\n\r\n[https://medium.com/fullstack-academy/thunks-in-redux-the-basics-85e538a3fe60](https://medium.com/fullstack-academy/thunks-in-redux-the-basics-85e538a3fe60)\r\n\r\n## Redux-Thunk source code has only expanded to fourteen lines total from its birth in 2016\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk/blob/master/src/index.js\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction createThunkMiddleware(extraArgument) {\r\n  return ({ dispatch, getState }) => next => action => {\r\n    if (typeof action === \"function\") {\r\n      return action(dispatch, getState, extraArgument);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return next(action);\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst thunk = createThunkMiddleware();\r\nthunk.withExtraArgument = createThunkMiddleware;\r\n\r\nexport default thunk;\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is a side-effect?\r\n\r\n\"Side Effect\" is not a react-specific term. It is a general concept about behaviours of functions. A function is said to have side effect if it trys to modify anything outside its body. For example, if it modifies a global variable, then it is a side effect. If it makes a network call, it is a side effect as well.\r\n\r\nA \"side effect\" is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed. These can be, say, a network request, which has your code communicating with a third party (and thus making the request, causing logs to be recorded, caches to be saved or updated, all sorts of effects that are outside the function.\r\n\r\nThere are more subtle side effects, too. Changing the value of a closure-scoped variable is a side effect. Pushing a new item onto an array that was passed in as an argument is a side effect. Functions that execute without side effects are called \"pure\" functions: they take in arguments, and they return values. Nothing else happens upon executing the function. This makes the easy to test, simple to reason about, and functions that meet this description have all sorts of useful properties when it comes to optimization or refactoring.\r\n\r\nPure functions are deterministic (meaning that, given an input, they always return the same output), but that doesn't mean that all impure functions have side effects. Generating a random value within a function makes it impure, but isn't a side effect, for example.\r\n\r\n#### What is side-effects in Redux or React\r\n\r\nThe natural Redux flow is this: some action is dispatched, and as a consequence, some state is changed.\r\n\r\nBut, most apps need to reach out to the outside world to be useful — whether by talking to the server, accessing local storage, recording analytics events, or something else entirely.\r\n\r\nThat process of calling into the real world is what side-effects are. They are a way of bridging the pure Redux world with the outside world.\r\n\r\nBut, we can’t handle side effects in reducers (they’re pure functions, they aren’t meant for making API calls).\r\n\r\nThunks transform action creators so that they can return functions (rather than JSON objects representing actions). We can then use these functions to make API requests and trigger dispatch calls to our redux store.\r\n\r\n### Other sources to Read\r\n\r\n1> This is the recommended one by thunk's own github page\r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35411423/how-to-dispatch-a-redux-action-with-a-timeout/35415559#35415559](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35411423/how-to-dispatch-a-redux-action-with-a-timeout/35415559#35415559)\r\n\r\n2> [https://medium.com/@gethylgeorge/understanding-how-redux-thunk-works-72de3bdebc50](https://medium.com/@gethylgeorge/understanding-how-redux-thunk-works-72de3bdebc50)\r\n\r\n3> [https://medium.com/@shoshanarosenfield/redux-thunk-vs-redux-saga-93fe82878b2d](https://medium.com/@shoshanarosenfield/redux-thunk-vs-redux-saga-93fe82878b2d)\r\n"

        "content": "## 1> What are Thunks?\r\n\r\nThunks are a functional programming technique used to delay computation. Instead of performing some work now, you produce a function body or unevaluated expression (the “thunk”) which can optionally be used to perform the work later. Compare:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Eager version\r\nfunction yell (text) {\r\n  console.log(text + '!')\r\n}\r\n\r\nyell('bonjour') // 'bonjour!'\r\n\r\n// Lazy (or \"thunked\") version\r\nfunction thunkedYell (text) {\r\n  return function thunk () {\r\n    console.log(text + '!')\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst thunk = thunkedYell('bonjour') // no action yet.\r\n\r\n// wait for it…\r\n\r\nthunk() // 'bonjour!'\r\n\r\n```\r\nNamed functions help to highlight the thunk, but the distinction is made clearer using arrows. Notice how a thunk (the function returned from thunkedYell(…)) requires an extra invocation before the work is executed:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst yell        = text =>       console.log(text + '!')\r\nconst thunkedYell = text => () => console.log(text + '!')\r\n```\r\n\r\nLaziness is a powerful technique which can be implemented in JavaScript via various approaches and language features, including getters, proxies, and generators.\r\n\r\n### Thunks in React & Redux\r\n\r\nIn React / Redux, thunks enable us to avoid directly causing side effects in our actions, action creators, or components. Instead, anything impure will be wrapped in a thunk. Later, that thunk will be invoked by middleware to actually cause the effect. By transferring our side effects to running at a single point of the Redux loop (at the middleware level), the rest of our app stays relatively pure. Pure functions and components are easier to reason about, test, maintain, extend,and reuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/fullstack-academy/thunks-in-redux-the-basics-85e538a3fe60\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2> In computer programming, a thunk is a subroutine used to inject an additional calculation into another subroutine. Thunks are primarily used to delay a calculation until its result is needed, or to insert operations at the beginning or end of the other subroutine. They have a variety of other applications in compiler code generation and modular programming.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk\r\n\r\n3> It is really simple. When you have some computation, like adding 3 to 5, in your program, then creating a thunk of it means not to calculate it directly, but instead create a function with zero arguments that will calculate it when the actual value is needed.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/925365/what-is-a-thunk-as-used-in-scheme-or-in-general\r\n\r\n4> With the help of the above two features, thunk encapsulates computations without evaluation, in other words, thunk does not store the actual value; instead, it stores the way of how the value would be computed. And the actual compuations will be carried out only when you decide so.\r\n\r\nhttp://typeocaml.com/2014/11/06/magic-of-thunk/\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "## Tiny URL shortner - Discuss things like:\r\n\r\nHow to generate a unique ID for each URL?\r\n\r\n[http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/2016/03/08/system-design-interview-question-create-tinyurl-system/](http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/2016/03/08/system-design-interview-question-create-tinyurl-system/)\r\n\r\nAt first glance, each long URL and the corresponding alias form a key-value pair.\r\nIn a certain sense, a URL shortener is a giant hash table, which maps integer values to full URL strings. The integer values are represented in the \"shortened\" URL by a short sequence of characters, which may encode this integer in something like base-64 notation. An alphabet of 64 characters is used, each character representing 6 bits of an encoded number that is used as the key to the hash table.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the question can be simplified like this – given a URL, how can we find hash function F that maps URL to a short alias:\r\nF(URL) = alias\r\nand satisfies following condition:s\r\n\r\n### Each URL can only be mapped to a unique alias\r\n\r\n### Each alias can be mapped back to a unique URL easily\r\n\r\nThe second condition is the core as in the run time, the system should look up by alias and redirect to the corresponding URL quickly.\r\n\r\n## Performance VS flexibility\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few follow-up questions for this problem. One thing I’d like to further discuss here is that by using GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) as the entry ID, what would be pros/cons versus incremental ID in this problem?\r\n\r\nIf you dig into the insert/query process, you will notice that using random string as IDs may sacrifice performance a little bit. More specifically, when you already have millions of records, insertion can be costly. Since IDs are not sequential, so every time a new record is inserted, the database needs to go look at the correct page for this ID. However, when using incremental IDs, insertion can be much easier – just go to the last page.\r\n\r\nSo one way to optimize this is to use incremental IDs. Every time a new URL is inserted, we increment the ID by 1 for the new entry. We also need a hash function that maps each integer ID to a 7-character string. If we think each string as a 62-base numeric, the mapping should be easy (Of course, there are other ways).\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, using incremental IDs will make the mapping less flexible. For instance, if the system allows users to set custom short URL, apparently GUID solution is easier because for whatever custom short URL, we can just calculate the corresponding hash as the entry ID.\r\n\r\n## Cost\r\n\r\nI can hardly not ask about how to evaluate the cost of the system. For insert/query, we’ve already discussed above. So I’ll focus more on storage cost.\r\n\r\nEach entry is stored as <ID, URL> where ID is a 7-character string. Assuming max URL length is 2083 characters, then each entry takes 7 _ 4 bytes + 2083 _ 4 bytes = 8.4 KB. If we store a million URL mappings, we need around 8.4G storage.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the size of database index and we may also store other information like user ID, date each entry is inserted etc., it definitely requires much more storage.\r\n\r\n## How would you generate unique IDs at scale (thousands of URL shortening requests coming every second)?\r\n\r\n## How would your service handle redirects?\r\n\r\n## How would you support custom short URLs?\r\n\r\n## How to delete expired URLs etc?\r\n\r\n## How to track click stats?\r\n\r\n## What characters can we allow in our randomly-generated slugs?\r\n\r\n[https://www.interviewcake.com/question/java/url-shortener](https://www.interviewcake.com/question/java/url-shortener)\r\n\r\nIt turns out the answer is \"only alphanumerics, the special characters \"\\$-\\_.+!\\*'(),\", and reserved characters used for their reserved purposes may be used unencoded within a URL\" (RFC 1738). \"Reserved characters\" with \"reserved purposes\" are characters like '?', which marks the beginning of a query string, and '#', which marks the beginning of a fragment/anchor. We definitely shouldn't use any of those. If we allowed '?' in the beginning of our slug, the characters after it would be interpreted as part of the query string and not part of the slug!\r\n\r\nOkay, so it seems like the set of allowed characters is A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and \"\\$-\\_.+!\\*'(),\". The apostrophe character seems a little iffy, since sometimes URLs are surrounded by single quotes in HTML documents. So let's pull that one.\r\n\r\n## What about uppercase and lowercase?\r\n\r\n[https://www.interviewcake.com/question/java/url-shortener](https://www.interviewcake.com/question/java/url-shortener)\r\n\r\nDomains aren't case-sensitive (so google.com and Google.com will always go to the same place), but the path portion of a URL is case-sensitive. If I query parker.com/foo and parker.com/Foo, I'm requesting different documents (although, as a site owner, I may choose to return the same document in response to both requests). So yes, lowercase and capital versions of the same letter can be treated as different characters in our slugs.\r\n"

Instant Messaging:\r\n\r\nThis is the basis of your app’s success, and a basic feature of all chat apps. It operates largely through a user’s connection to the internet, and even when they go offline, users are able to receive all the notifications they missed when they go back online. Will the app host custom fonts, stickers, and emojis, or a “mute chat” feature for those group chats that never stop buzzing? A scheduling in advance feature could also draw users (e.g. push notification reminders of upcoming birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays). Skype does this to a limited degree, but you can take it further.\r\n\r\n##### 2. Real Time Connectivity:\r\n\r\nLinked to the ‘instant’ in instant messaging, real time connectivity is the preferred medium for chat apps, because message delivery happens promptly and immediately, without any distance barriers, making users feel closer to each other.\r\n\r\n##### 1. VOIP Phone Calls:\r\n\r\nVoice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) is the classification of technologies to deliver the voice communication and multimedia sessions over the Internet Protocol.\r\n\r\n##### 2. Video Chats:\r\n\r\nLets to make calls directly to communicate with a personal touch experience with voice/video without an intermediate connection.\r\n\r\n##### 3. Group Calls:\r\n\r\nThe chat app allows the user further to connect with other users with the facilitation of group conversation through Video/Audio.\r\n\r\n##### 4. End-to-End Chat Encryption:\r\n\r\nUser safe encryption to secure from third-party infiltration. Prioritize in user private data security through advanced premium encryption technologies.\r\n\r\n##### 5. Cloud Service Sync:\r\n\r\nCloud Resource Platform synchronization to monitor, update, store and scale the hosting environment.\r\n\r\n##### 6. Multimedia Support:\r\n\r\nFile transfer of various data formats such as video, images, Gifs, voice note, animation, documents, contact, and location.\r\n\r\n##### 7. Self — Destructing Messages:\r\n\r\nLets to send a whisper by tapping on the recipient name in a group where the messages can’t be seen by other persons.\r\n\r\n##### 8. Geolocation Integration:\r\n\r\nEnhanced geolocation integration makes quite an effective flow of interaction on a real-time basis.\r\n\r\n##### 9. Calendar Synchronization:\r\n\r\nCalendar sync provides a thorough knowledge of the events and tasks that will appear where you are yet to plan your day.\r\n\r\n##### 10. Multi-platform Chatting:\r\n\r\nThe cross-platform messaging will allow you to be engaged within your reach while at a desk or on the go.\r\n\r\n##### 11. In-app Purchase:\r\n\r\nChoose your right monetization strategy to sell your app on the digital store to increase your app’s revenue stream.\r\n\r\n##### 12. Payment Integration:\r\n\r\nUPI — Unified Payment Interface is one of the payment modules which is more secure, user-friendly and allows instant payment.\r\n\r\nVPA — Virtual Payment Address will use the email address which is registered in the particular bank account that can be shared publicly instead of a bank account number and IFSC code.\r\n\r\nMPIN — Mobile banking Personal Identification Number is a 4–6 digit security code used to authenticate all types of money transferred via UPI\r\n"

            "content": "Normally, we can put normal JS code and get no help from what TypeScript has to offer. In order to TS to force us to actually type our code, we need to change the ‘tsconfig.json’ file. In particular, we will focus on two compiler options that will force our code to be actually typed:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"noImplicitAny\": true,\r\n\"strictNullChecks\": true,\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet’s imagine we have a simple mortgage simulator that tells the user if, given his financial situation, a mortgage is viable or not. For that, we will have a function that will retrieve somehow the savings user has:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction getSavings() {\r\n  //returns savings\r\n}\r\n\r\n// And a function to decide if a mortgage is feasible:\r\n\r\nfunction concedeMortgage(homeValue) {\r\n  const savings = getSavings()\r\n  return savings / homeValue > 0.2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, to make it actually work, we would need to check if the input exists. And also if it’s a number or not. The same applies for the return value from `getSavings`, since he don’t know what is the return type of that function. Therefore, our code could end up looking something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction concedeMortgage(homeValue) {\r\n  if (!homeValue || !parseFloat(homeValue)) return false\r\n  const savings = getSavings()\r\n  if (!savings || !parseFloat(savings)) return false\r\n  return savings / homeValue > 0.2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich looks quite terrible.\r\n\r\nBut, if we activate the `noImplicitAny` compiler option, it would be no longer necessary to check if the input value and the return from `getSavings` are of type of number, so the function could look something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction concedeMortgage(homeValue: number): boolean {\r\n  if (!homeValue) return false\r\n  const savings = getSavings()\r\n  if (!savings) return false\r\n  return savings / homeValue > 0.2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is an improvement, since the compiler would help us to avoid some mistakes and typos, not allowing us calling the function with a string, per example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconcedeMortgage(\"foo\") // ERROR! Argument of type 'foo' is not assignable to parameter type 'number'\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, null and undefined are still in the domain of every type, therefore it would be possible to do this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconcedeMortgage(null) // Still works\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix that, we need activate the other option in the tsconfig.json file we mentioned: ‘strictNullChecks’.\r\n\r\nNow, doing the call to the function with null, would end up caught by the compiler:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconcedeMortgage(null) // ERROR! Argument of type 'null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat meaning, the check of null values is not needed by code, simplifying the logic to something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction concedeMortgage(homeValue: number): boolean {\r\n  const savings = getSavings()\r\n  return savings / homeValue > 0.2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is just a small glance at what TypeScript can give you if you migrate your project from plain JS to it.\r\n\r\n### Further Reading\r\n\r\n[https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/migrate-javascript-to-typescript/](https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/migrate-javascript-to-typescript/)\r\n"

This just means that HTTP works on top of TCP. TCP is in charge of setting up a reliable connection between two machines and HTTP uses this connection to transfer data between the server and the client. HTTP is used for transferring data while TCP is in charge of setting up a connection which should be used by HTTP in the communication process. Without TCP, HTTP cannot function (to be crisp).\r\n\r\n**4.** HTTP is a top layer(application layer) protocol that takes the payload(data of user), adds it's own header bits(required for control purposes) and passes down the package to a layer below.\r\nTCP is a middle layer protocol whose main job is to chop the payload coming from above layers into multiple segments so that they can be transmitted(because there are packet size limitations, MTU-maximum transmission unit). TCP adds it's own header bits to each of the segments and then passes them to the layer below.\r\n\r\n**5.** Also, Look at the steps below in a high level that occurs at the background when a user tried to access a website.\r\n\r\nDNS Resolution -> TCP Handshake -> HTTP using the connection to exchange information between two machines.\r\n\r\n**6.** TCP is a protocol that controls reliable and smooth transfer of DATA from source host :port to a destination host:port. It takes care of in-order and reliable delivery of a BYTESTREAM of data. It does NOT interpret the bytes within the DATA. TCP also employs rate control mechanisms (cong. mgmt.) in order to use the network BW optimally while at the same time be not greedy.\r\n\r\nHTTP on the other hand is _only_ interested in using the BYTESTREAM to demarcate it into messages between a WebServer and WebClient/browser. It uses TCP to transfer the messages, so it doesn’t have to worry about sequence, reliability or worry about the size of message. There are command primitives like GET, POST, etc., for client to communicate with server and request which data it wants from the server.\r\n\r\n**7.** To use an analogy, TCP is your Postal Service, and HTTP is your letters, words, messages, requests and commands that go into the envelopes. The Postal Service just focuses on delivering the letter to the sender..\r\n\r\n#### So, here is in some more details\r\n\r\nTo understand the difference (and a lot of other networking topics), you need to understand the idea of a layered networking model. Essentially, there are different protocols that let a computer talk at different distances and different layers of abstraction.\r\n\r\n## At the very bottom of the network stack is the physical layer.\r\n\r\nThis is where electrical signals or light pulses or radio waves actually transmit information from place to place. The physical layer doesn't really have protocols, but instead has standards for voltages, frequencies, and other physical properties. You can transmit information directly this way, but you need a lot of power or a dedicated line, and without higher layers you won't be able to share bandwidth.\r\n\r\n## The next layer up is the link layer.\r\n\r\nThis layer covers communication with devices that share a physical communications medium. Here, protocols like Ethernet, 802.11a/b/g/n, and Token Ring specify how to handle multiple concurrent accesses to the physical medium and how to direct traffic to one device instead of another. In a typical home network, this is how your computer talks to your home \"router.\"\r\n\r\n## The third layer is the network layer.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases, this is dominated by Internet Protocol (IP). This is where the magic of the Internet happens, and you get to talk to a computer halfway around the world, without needing to know where it is. Routers handle directing your traffic from your local network to the network where the other computer lives, where its own link layer handles getting the packets to the right computer.\r\n\r\n## The transport layer takes care (The home of TCP)\r\nNow we can talk to a computer somewhere around the world, but that computer is running lots of different programs. How should it know which one to deliver your message to? The transport layer takes care of this, usually with port numbers. The two most popular transport layer protocols are TCP and UDP. TCP does a lot of interesting things to smooth over the rough spots of network-layer packet-switched communication like reordering packets, retransmitting lost packets, etc. UDP is more unreliable, but has less overhead.\r\n\r\n## The application-layer (home of HTTP)\r\nSo we've connected your browser to the web server software on the other end, but how does the server know what page you want? How can you post a question or an answer? These are things that application-layer protocols handle. For web traffic, this is the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). There are thousands of application-layer protocols: SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 for email; XMPP, IRC, ICQ for chat; Telnet, SSH, RDP for remote administration; etc.\r\n\r\nThese are the five layers of the TCP/IP networking model, but they are really only conceptual. The OSI model has 7 layers. In reality, some protocols shim between various layers, or can work at multiple layers at once. TLS/SSL for instance provides encryption and session information between the network and transport layers. Above the application layer, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) govern communication with web applications like Quora, Twitter, and Facebook."

With this method, you can create a new resource or overwrite an existing one given you know the exact Request-URI.\r\n\r\nPUT puts a file or resource at a specific URI, and exactly at that URI.\r\n\r\nAn HTTP PUT is supposed to accept the body of the request, and then store that at the resource identified by the URI.\r\n\r\n## What Does the POST Method Do?\r\n\r\nThe HTTP POST method is used to send user-generated data to the web server. For example, a POST method is used when a user comments on a forum or if they upload a profile picture. A POST method should also be used if you do not know the specific URL of where your newly created resource should reside.\r\nPOST sends data to a specific URI and expects the resource at that URI to handle the request. The web server at this point can determine what to do with the data in the context of the specified resource. The POST method is not idempotent, however POST responses are cacheable so long as the server sets the appropriate Cache-Control and Expires headers.\r\n\r\nThe official HTTP RFC specifies POST to be:\r\n\r\nAnnotation of existing resources;\r\nPosting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or similar group of articles;\r\nProviding a block of data, such as the result of submitting a form, to a data-handling process;\r\nExtending a database through an append operation.\r\nAn HTTP POST is more general. It is supposed to initiate an action on the server."

It is a request/response protocol: clients issue requests and servers issue responses with relevant content and completion status info about the request.  This self-contained design allows for the distributed nature of the Internet, where a request or response might pass through many intermediate routers and proxy servers. It also allows intermediary servers to perform value-added functions such as load balancing, caching, encryption, and compression.\r\n\r\nA basic HTTP request consists of a verb (method) and a resource (endpoint).  Below are common HTTP verbs:\r\n\r\n| Verb | Description | Idempotent* | Safe | Cacheable |\r\n|---|---|---|---|---|\r\n| GET | Reads a resource | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| POST | Creates a resource or trigger a process that handles data | No | No | Yes if response contains freshness info |\r\n| PUT | Creates or replace a resource | Yes | No | No |\r\n| PATCH | Partially updates a resource | No | No | Yes if response contains freshness info |\r\n| DELETE | Deletes a resource | Yes | No | No |\r\n\r\n*Can be called many times without different outcomes.\r\n\r\nHTTP is an application layer protocol relying on lower-level protocols such as **TCP** and **UDP**.\r\n\r\n## What is that HTTPS?\r\n\r\nNow you understand HTTP then what is that HTTPS? HTTPS is the secured HTTP protocol required to send and receive information securely over internet. Nowadays it is mandatory for all websites to have HTTPS protocol to have secured internet. Browsers like Google Chrome will show an alert with “Not Secure” message in the address bar if the site is not served over HTTPS.\r\n\r\nBesides the security and encryption, the communication structure of HTTPS protocol remains same as HTTP protocol as explained above."

        "content": "### Details of HTTP Status Codes\r\nThe HTTP status codes are developed as per the Internet standards defined by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). They are classified into five different categories as below:\r\n\r\n1xx series – Informational Message\r\n2xx – Success Message\r\n3xx – Redirection Message\r\n4xx – Error Messages Related to Client\r\n5xx – Error Messages Related to Server\r\n\r\n### Informational Series – 1xx\r\n\r\nThese are the informational codes send by the server indicating that the request is received from the client successfully and the same is under processing at the server end. This is a provisional response from the server normally contains only the status line and optional headers and is terminated with an empty line. Learn more about each 1xx status codes in detail.\r\n\r\n### Success Series – 2xx\r\n\r\nThese are the success codes send by the server indicating that the request is received and processed successfully. Learn more about each 2xx status codes in detail.\r\n\r\n### Redirection – 3xx\r\n\r\nThese are the status codes for redirection. When a user agent (a web browser or a crawler) requesting URL1 is redirected to another resource URL2 then 3xx codes are returned as a response. These codes are not seen in the browser window since browsers are auto redirected to another URL. Learn more about each 3xx status codes in detail.\r\n\r\n### Client Errors – 4xx\r\nThese are the errors from the client side which the server could not resolve. Simple and well known example is a “404 – Page Not Found” error displayed in the browser window when an unavailable URL is requested by the browser. Learn more about each 4xx status codes in detail.\r\n\r\n### Server Errors Series – 5xx\r\n\r\nWhen a web server can’t fulfill a valid request from a client it sends a 5xx error code in the response. An example is “504 – Gateway Timeout” error where the web server1 is acting as a proxy to get a response from another web server2  but failed to receive a timely response. Learn more about each 5xx status codes in detail.\r\n\r\n# List of codes\r\n\r\nThe list is separated by kind.\r\n\r\n### Informational 1xx\r\n- [100](http://httpstatus.es/100) - **Continue** - Client should continue with request.\r\n- [101](http://httpstatus.es/101) - **Switching Protocols** - Server is switching protocols.\r\n- [102](http://httpstatus.es/102) - **Processing** - Server has received and is processing the request.\r\n- [103](http://httpstatus.es/102) - **Processing** - Server has received and is processing the request.\r\n- [122](http://httpstatus.es/102) - **Request-uri too long** - URI is longer than a maximum of 2083 characters.\r\n### Success 2xx\r\nThese codes indicate success. The body section if present is the object returned by the request. It is a MIME format object. It is in MIME format, and may only be in text/plain, text/html or one fo the formats specified as acceptable in the request.\r\n- [200](http://httpstatus.es/200) - **Ok** - The request was fulfilled.\r\n- [201](http://httpstatus.es/201) - **Created** - Following a POST command, this indicates success, but the textual part of the response line indicates the URI by which the newly created document should be known.\r\n- [202](http://httpstatus.es/202) - **Accepted** - The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request may or may not eventually be acted upon, as it may be disallowed when processing actually takes place. there is no facility for status returns from asynchronous operations such as this.\r\n- [203](http://httpstatus.es/203) - **Partial Information** - When received in the response to a GET command, this indicates that the returned metainformation is not a definitive set of the object from a server with a copy of the object, but is from a private overlaid web. This may include annotation information about the object, for example.\r\n- [204](http://httpstatus.es/204) - **No Response** - Server has received the request but there is no information to send back, and the client should stay in the same document view. This is mainly to allow input for scripts without changing the document at the same time.\r\n- [205](http://httpstatus.es/205) - **Reset Content** - Request processed, no content returned, reset document view.\r\n- [206](http://httpstatus.es/206) - **Partial Content** - partial resource return due to request header.\r\n- [207](http://httpstatus.es/207) - **Multi-Status** - XML, can contain multiple separate responses.\r\n- [208](http://httpstatus.es/208) - **Already Reported** - results previously returned.\r\n- [226](http://httpstatus.es/226) - **Im Used** - request fulfilled, reponse is instance-manipulations.\r\n### Redirection 3xx\r\nThe codes in this section indicate action to be taken (normally automatically) by the client in order to fulfill the request.\r\n- [301](http://httpstatus.es/301) - **Moved** - The data requested has been assigned a new URI, the change is permanent. (N.B. this is an optimisation, which must, pragmatically, be included in this definition. Browsers with link editing capabiliy should automatically relink to the new reference, where possible)\r\n- [302](http://httpstatus.es/302) - **Found** - The data requested actually resides under a different URL, however, the redirection may be altered on occasion (when making links to these kinds of document, the browser should default to using the Udi of the redirection document, but have the option of linking to the final document) as for \"Forward\".\r\n- [303](http://httpstatus.es/303) - **Method** - Like the found response, this suggests that the client go try another network address. In this case, a different method may be used too, rather than GET.\r\n- [304](http://httpstatus.es/304) - **Not Modified** - If the client has done a conditional GET and access is allowed, but the document has not been modified since the date and time specified in If-Modified-Since field, the server responds with a 304 status code and does not send the document body to the client.\r\n- [305](http://httpstatus.es/305) - **Use Proxy** - Content located elsewhere, retrieve from there.\r\n- [306](http://httpstatus.es/306) - **Switch Proxy** - Subsequent requests should use the specified proxy.\r\n- [307](http://httpstatus.es/307) - **Temporary Redirect** - Connect again to different URI as provided.\r\n- [308](http://httpstatus.es/308) - **Permanent Redirect** - Connect again to a different URI using the same method.\r\n### Client side errors 4xx\r\nThe 4xx codes are intended for cases in which the client seems to have erred, and the 5xx codes for the cases in which the server is aware that the server has erred. It is impossible to distinguish these cases in general, so the difference is only informational.\r\nThe body section may contain a document describing the error in human readable form. The document is in MIME format, and may only be in text/plain, text/html or one for the formats specified as acceptable in the request.\r\n- [400](http://httpstatus.es/400) - **Bad Request** - The request had bad syntax or was inherently impossible to be satisfied.\r\n- [401](http://httpstatus.es/401) - **Unauthorized** - The parameter to this message gives a specification of authorization schemes which are acceptable. The client should retry the request with a suitable [Authorization](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#z9) header.\r\n- [402](http://httpstatus.es/402) - **Payment Required** - The parameter to this message gives a specification of charging schemes acceptable. The client may retry the request with a suitable ChargeTo header.\r\n- [403](http://httpstatus.es/403) - **Forbidden** - The request is for something forbidden. Authorization will not help.\r\n- [404](http://httpstatus.es/404) - **Not Found** - The server has not found anything matching the URI given.\r\n- [405](http://httpstatus.es/405) - **Method Not Allowed** - Request method not supported by that resource.\r\n- [406](http://httpstatus.es/406) - **Not Acceptable** - Content not acceptable according to the Accept headers.\r\n- [407](http://httpstatus.es/407) - **Proxy Authentication Required** - Client must first authenticate itself with the proxy.\r\n- [408](http://httpstatus.es/408) - **Request Timeout** - Server timed out waiting for the request.\r\n- [409](http://httpstatus.es/409) - **Conflict** - Request could not be processed because of conflict.\r\n- [410](http://httpstatus.es/410) - **Gone** - Resource is no longer available and will not be available again.\r\n- [411](http://httpstatus.es/411) - **Length Required** - Request did not specify the length of its content.\r\n- [412](http://httpstatus.es/412) - **Precondition Failed** - Server does not meet request preconditions.\r\n- [413](http://httpstatus.es/413) - **Request Entity Too Large** - Request is larger than the server is willing or able to process.\r\n- [414](http://httpstatus.es/414) - **Request URI Too Large** - URI provided was too long for the server to process.\r\n- [415](http://httpstatus.es/415) - **Unsupported Media Type** - Server does not support media type.\r\n- [416](http://httpstatus.es/416) - **Requested Rage Not Satisfiable** - Client has asked for unprovidable portion of the file.\r\n- [417](http://httpstatus.es/417) - **Expectation Failed** - Server cannot meet requirements of Expect request-header field.\r\n- [418](http://httpstatus.es/418) - **I'm a teapot** - I'm a teapot.\r\n- [420](http://httpstatus.es/420) - **Enhance Your Calm** - Twitter rate limiting.\r\n- [421](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#page-66) - **Misdirected Request** - Server is not able to produce a response.\r\n- [422](http://httpstatus.es/422) - **Unprocessable Entity** - Request unable to be followed due to semantic errors.\r\n- [423](http://httpstatus.es/423) - **Locked** - Resource that is being accessed is locked.\r\n- [424](http://httpstatus.es/424) - **Failed Dependency** - Request failed due to failure of a previous request.\r\n- [426](http://httpstatus.es/426) - **Upgrade Required** - Client should switch to a different protocol.\r\n- [428](http://httpstatus.es/428) - **Precondition Required** - Origin server requires the request to be conditional.\r\n- [429](http://httpstatus.es/429) - **Too Many Requests** - User has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.\r\n- [431](http://httpstatus.es/429) - **Request Header Fields Too Large** - Server is unwilling to process the request.\r\n- [444](http://httpstatus.es/444) - **No Response** - Server returns no information and closes the connection.\r\n- [449](http://httpstatus.es/449) - **Retry With** - Request should be retried after performing action.\r\n- [450](http://httpstatus.es/450) - **Blocked By Windows Parental Controls** - Windows Parental Controls blocking access to webpage.\r\n- [451](http://httpstatus.es/451) - **Wrong Exchange Server** - The server cannot reach the client's mailbox.\r\n- [499](http://httpstatus.es/499) - **Client Closed Request** - Connection closed by client while HTTP server is processing.\r\n### Server side error 5xx\r\nThis means that even though the request appeared to be valid something went wrong at the server level and it wasn’t able to return anything.\r\n- [500](http://httpstatus.es/500) - **Internal Error** - The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.\r\n- [501](http://httpstatus.es/501) - **Not Implemented** - The server does not support the facility required.\r\n- [502](http://httpstatus.es/502) - **Service temporarily overloaded** - The server cannot process the request due to a high load (whether HTTP servicing or other requests). The implication is that this is a temporary condition which maybe alleviated at other times.\r\n- [503](http://httpstatus.es/503) - **Gateway timeout** - This is equivalent to Internal Error 500, but in the case of a server which is in turn accessing some other service, this indicates that the respose from the other service did not return within a time that the gateway was prepared to wait. As from the point of view of the clientand the HTTP transaction the other service is hidden within the server, this maybe treated identically to Internal error 500, but has more diagnostic value.\r\n- [504](http://httpstatus.es/504) - **Gateway Timeout** - Gateway did not receive response from upstream server.\r\n- [505](http://httpstatus.es/505) - **Http Version Not Supported** - Server does not support the HTTP protocol version.\r\n- [506](http://httpstatus.es/506) - **Variant Also Negotiates** - Content negotiation for the request results in a circular reference.\r\n- [507](http://httpstatus.es/507) - **Insufficient Storage** - Server is unable to store the representation.\r\n- [508](http://httpstatus.es/508) - **Loop Detected** - Server detected an infinite loop while processing the request.\r\n- [509](http://httpstatus.es/509) - **Bandwidth Limit Exceeded** - Bandwidth limit exceeded.\r\n- [510](http://httpstatus.es/510) - **Not Extended** - Further extensions to the request are required.\r\n- [511](http://httpstatus.es/511) - **Network Authentication Required** - Client needs to authenticate to gain network access.\r\n- [598](http://httpstatus.es/598) - **Network Read Timeout Error** - Network read timeout behind the proxy.\r\n- [599](http://httpstatus.es/599) - **Network Connect Timeout Error** - Network connect timeout behind the proxy.\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "## What’s difference between http:// and https:// ?\r\n\r\n## https = http + cryptographic protocols.\r\n\r\n### HTTPS: Encrypted Connections\r\n\r\nThe two are essentially the same, in that both of them refer to the same “hypertext transfer protocol” that enables requested web data to be presented on your screen. But, HTTPS is still slightly different, more advanced, and much more secure.\r\n\r\nSimply put, HTTPS protocol is an extension of HTTP. That “S” in the abbreviation comes from the word Secure and it is powered by Transport Layer Security (TLS) [the successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)], the standard security technology that establishes an encrypted connection between a web server and a browser.\r\n\r\nWithout HTTPS, any data you enter into the site (such as your username/password, credit card or bank details, any other form submission data, etc.) will be sent plaintext and therefore susceptible to interception or eavesdropping. For this reason, you should always check that a site is using HTTPS before you enter any information.\r\n\r\nIn addition to encrypting the data transmitted between the server and your browser, TLS also authenticates the server you are connecting to and protects that transmitted data from tampering.\r\n\r\nAlso, to achieve this security in https, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is used because public keys can be used by several Web Browsers while private key can be used by the Web Server of that particular website. The distribution of these public keys is done via Certificates which are maintained by the Browser. You can check these certificates in your Browser settings.\r\n\r\n## Differences between HTTP and HTTPS - some key points\r\n\r\nIn HTTP, URL begins with “http://” whereas URL starts with “https://”\r\n\r\nHTTP uses port number 80 for communication and HTTPS uses 443\r\n\r\nHTTP Works at Application Layer and HTTPS works at Transport Layer\r\n\r\nIn HTTP, Encryption is absent and Encryption is present in HTTPS as discussed above\r\n\r\nHTTP does not require any certificates and HTTPS needs SSL Certificates\r\n\r\nWith HTTPS if anyone in between the sender and the recipient could open the message, they still could not understand it. Only the sender and the recipient, who know the \"code,\" can decipher the message.\r\n\r\n### To do this, the computer at each end uses a document called an \"SSL Certificate\" containing character strings that are the keys to their secret \"codes.\"\r\n\r\n## SSL certificates contain the computer owner's \"public key.\"\r\n\r\nThe owner shares the public key with anyone who needs it. Other users need the public key to encrypt messages to the owner. The owner sends those users the SSL certificate, which contains the public key. The owner does not share the private key with anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Advantages of HTTPS\r\nIn most cases, sites running over HTTPS will have a redirect in place. Therefore, even if you type in HTTP:// it will redirect to an https over a secured connection\r\n\r\nIt allows users to perform secure e-commerce transaction, such as online banking.\r\n\r\nSSL technology protects any users and builds trust\r\n\r\nAn independent authority verifies the identity of the certificate owner. So each SSL Certificate contains unique, authenticated information about the certificate owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Limitations of HTTPS\r\n\r\nHTTPS protocol can't stop stealing confidential information from the pages cached on the browser\r\n\r\nSSL data can be encrypted only during transmission on the network. So it can't clear the text in the browser memory\r\n\r\nHTTPS can increase computational overhead as well as network overhead of the organization"

This ensures that your pages are as lean as possible.\r\n\r\nCombining files is exactly what it sounds like. If your site runs multiple CSS and JavaScript files, you can combine them into one.\r\n\r\n## Show spinner or progress bar - perceived\r\n\r\n## Preload the page before actually loading it using libraries like InstantClick - both actual and perceived\r\n\r\n## Minimize HTTP requests\r\n\r\nAccording to Yahoo, 80% of a Web page’s load time is spent downloading the different parts of the page, like images, stylesheets, and scripts.\r\n\r\nAn HTTP request is made for each one of these elements, so the more on-page components, the longer it takes for the page to render.\r\n\r\nThe first step to minimizing your requests is to figure out how many your site currently makes, to use as a benchmark.\r\n\r\nIf you use Google Chrome, you can use the browser’s Developer Tools to see how many HTTP requests your site makes.\r\n\r\nRight-click on the page you want to analyze, and click “Inspect,” then click the “Network” tab. (If you don’t see the “Network” tab, you may need to expand the Developer Tools sidebar by dragging the left border to the left.)\r\n\r\nThe “Name” column shows all of the files on the page, the “Size” column shows the size of each file, and the “Time” column shows how long it takes to load each file.\r\n\r\nIn the bottom left corner, you’ll also see the number of total requests the site makes.\r\n\r\nReducing this number of requests will speed up your site, look through your files and see if any are unnecessary.\r\n\r\n## This is why you should minimize HTTP requests. There are some excellent ways to do this.\r\n\r\nCombine CSS, JS scripts and HTML files together.\r\nUse CSS instead of images whenever possible.\r\nReduce the number of elements on every web page.\r\nInstall a caching plugin.\r\nReduce redirects, which create additional HTTP requests to your server and increase your page load time.\r\n\r\n## Use a CDN\r\n\r\n## Enable Browser Caching\r\n\r\n Caching refers to the process of storing static files, such as HTML documents, media files, images, CSS and JavaScript files, for easier and faster access, so that the database does not have to retrieve each and every file every time there is a new request. The more requests are being made to your server, the more time it will take for your website to load.\r\n\r\nWhen someone visits your website, the elements on the web page they are trying to access are automatically downloaded and stored on their hard drive in a cache (temporary storage). That way, the next time they visit your website, their browser will load the requested web page very quickly, without having to send an HTTP request to the server again.\r\n\r\nHowever, caching works for repeat visitors only, since, obviously, first-time visitors don’t have a cached and stored version of your website. Nevertheless, enabling full caching for your website can reduce your page load time from 2.4 to 0.9 seconds. This is due to the fact that there may be 30 or more different components that need to be stored in the user’s cache the first time they visit your website, but only a few components need to be downloaded for subsequent visits.\r\n\r\n## Optimize Your Images\r\n\r\nImages take up a lot of bandwidth. When they’re not optimized, meaning they are large in size, they use a lot of server resources and take more time to load. When your images are not optimized, your website can be much slower.\r\n\r\n## Disable Hotlinking\r\n\r\nIf you don’t disable hotlinking, you allow people to use the content that’s hosted on your server for their own websites. By allowing them to practically use your servers and your content for their websites, you’ll get a lot of server load for no reason.\r\n\r\nThis is why you should disable hotlinking and prevent people from stealing your server resources. However, in order to do that, you need to add the necessary code to your server. There are some tools that can help you generate the right code, but your web hosting provider can also help you with this\r\n\r\n## Optimize Your Database\r\n\r\nOptimizing your database is yet another very effective way to speed up your website. This is something you should do on a regular basis, especially if you use WordPress or some other CMS that relies a lot on database usage."

        "content": "### What is a WebSocket API?\r\n\r\nAccording to MDN, the WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With the WebSocket API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, WebSocket does not compromise with the security system of the web. All the WebSocket handshakes can be scrutinized by the browser using embedded developer tools in them.\r\n\r\nWebSocket represents a single TCP socket connection, thus eliminating the problem of connection limitation.\r\n\r\n### The differences between a WebSocket API and a FETCH API.\r\n\r\n- 1. WebSocket is a low-level protocol, based on the concept of socket and port, which are the underlying transport mechanism whereas REST is based on CRUD operation.\r\n- 2. WebSocket require the use of IP address and Port details, which are lower level details for any application whereas RESTful application needs to design operation based on verbs, and HTTP based.\r\n- 3. WebSocket is bi-directional in nature i.e. both way operation from client to server and vice versa is possible whereas REST follows a uni-directional approach.\r\n- 4. WebSocket approach is ideal for real-time scalable application, whereas REST is better suited for the scenario with lots of getting request.\r\n- 5. WebSocket is a stateful protocol whereas REST is based on stateless protocol i.e. client does not need to know about the server and same hold true for the server.\r\n- 6. WebSocket connection can scale vertically on a single server whereas REST, which is HTTP based can scale horizontally.\r\n- 7. WebSocket is ideal for a scenario where high loads are a part of game i.e. real-time scalable chat application whereas REST is better fitted for occasional communication, in a typical GET request scenario to call RESTful APIs.\r\n- 8. WebSocket works better, where client-server communicates over the same TCP connection for the life of web socket connection whereas, for HTTP request, a new TCP connection is initiated.\r\n- 9. WebSocket communication allows client and server to talk independently of each other whereas with the REST based approach, either client is talking to the client or server is talking to the client at any given time.\r\n- 10. WebSocket communication cost is lower whereas REST-based communication is comparatively higher end on the cost.\r\n\r\n### Interfaces\r\n\r\n#### WebSocket\r\n\r\nThe primary interface for connecting to a WebSocket server and then sending and receiving data on the connection.\r\n\r\n#### CloseEvent\r\n\r\nThe event sent by the WebSocket object when the connection closes.\r\n\r\n#### MessageEvent\r\n\r\nThe event sent by the WebSocket object when a message is received from the server.\r\n\r\nThe WebSocket object provides the API for creating and managing a WebSocket connection to a server, as well as for sending and receiving data on the connection.\r\n\r\nTo construct a WebSocket, use the WebSocket() constructor.\r\n"

Do the DNS query first, it will offer the most suitable IP address with the intelligent DNS parsing.\r\n2. The following is the TCP handshake. The application layer will deliver the data to the transport layer where the TCP protocols will point out the ports of both ends, and then transport the data to the network layer. The IP protocols in the network layer will determine the IP address and how to navigate to the router, and then the packet will be packaged to data frames. And at last is the physical transport.\r\n3. After the TCP handshake is the TLS handshake, and then is the formal data transport.\r\n4. It is possible for the data to go through the load balancing servers before its accesses to the server. The load balancing server will deliver the requests to the application servers and response with an HTML file.\r\n5. After getting the response, the browser will check the status code, it will continue parsing the file with the status code 200. As for 400 or 500, it will throw an error. If there is 300 code, it will redirect to a new URL. And there is also a redirection counter to avoiding too much redirection by throwing an error.\r\n6. The browser will parse the file, do decompression if the file type is with compressions like gzip and then parse the file by the encoding type.\r\n7. After the successful parsing, the render flow will start formally. It will construct the DOM tree by HTML and construct the CSSOM with CSS. If there is a `script` tag, browser will check it whether has the `async` or `defer` attributes, the former will download and execute the JS file in parallel, and the latter will load the file first then wait to execute until the HTML has been parsed. If none of them, it will block the render engine until the JS file has been executed. HTTP/2 may highly improve the download efficiency for pictures.\r\n8. The `DOMContentLoaded` event will be triggered after the initial HTML has been loaded and parsed completely.\r\n9. The Render tree will be constructed following the CSSOM and the DOM tree, in which the layout of page elements, styles and so on will be calculated.\r\n10. In the process of constructing the Render tree, the browser will call the GPU to paint, composite the layers and display the contents on the screen.\r\n\r\nFor much more detailed explanation - (https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when/blob/master/README.rst)[https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when/blob/master/README.rst]"

        "content": "First of all your computer has to interpret the signals coming through from your keyboard—each key press closes a specific electrical circuit that tells your computer the letters and symbols you’re hitting. The computer polls for new inputs every 10 milliseconds or so.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you click inside your browser’s address bar and press the “g” key all kinds of code whirs into action—your browser checks whether or not you’re in incognito mode, and if you aren’t, scours your bookmarks and history for potential matches. It’s also going to be looking for popular search terms on the web, and of course updating the URL and search suggestions as you add each successive letter.\r\n\r\nChances are, you’ll see “google.com” appear before you finish typing it, thanks to the smart algorithms built into your browser and whatever its default search engine is set to. This is confirmed with a tap on the Enter key, sending the Enter key code to the computer’s Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard driver, which passes it on to the operating system.\r\n\r\n## Making sense of what you’ve typed\r\n\r\nThe next step is to parse what you’ve typed into the address bar—is it a URL? Is it a search term? Is it some gibberish ? If the browser can spot a valid protocol (like HTTP) or domain name (like Google.com) it can open the page, otherwise it passes the query on to your default search engine, often with a code that indicates the referring browser.\r\n\r\n### Next, the browser performs a DNS lookup, which is like looking up someone’s home address—though in this case we’re trying to find where a website lives on the internet. The browser might have this information already stored if you’ve visited the site recently, so it checks its cache first; otherwise, it checks the online address book stored in your OS, and then a reputable one stored on the web, to try and find the site you want.\r\n\r\n## Making a connection to the site\r\n\r\nOnce the DNS lookup occurs there’s another layer of checking and counter-checking, known as an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) process. This actually works inside the DNS lookup to figure out whether you’re connecting to a machine on your own network or a site out on the wilds of the web. Finally, with the address and location of the website established, your browser can open up a socket: a connection between your computer and the site that allows for a two-way flow of information back and forth.\r\n\r\nThe next stage is a series of virtual introductions and pleasantries between your computer and the website you’ve requested (in this case Google.com). These involve establishing a common language so the displayed website actually makes sense, and going through some ID checks for the sake of security. Key to this is the Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake, the setup of secret keys to prove you’re on the right website.\r\n\r\nOnce everyone’s on good terms, the actual data transfer can start—browsers can make all kinds of requests to sites and vice versa, but here we just want the HTML and other code that makes up the Google.com home page. In the space of a few fractions of a second, the familiar search engine interface is showing up in your browser.\r\n\r\nNow your browser of choice has to interpret and accurately render all the information coming its way. It typically has to parse HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\r\n\r\nIt’s the browser’s rendering engine that does the bulk of this work, and the different browser developers have all deployed their own engines (which is why the layout of webpages sometimes varies between browsers): Chrome uses Blink, which is based on the WebKit engine that Safari uses, while Firefox has Gecko. Having used Trident in Internet Explorer, Microsoft now has EdgeHTML for its Edge browser, which is based on Trident.\r\n\r\nThe browser calls in the help of the CPU and the GPU on your computer as it interprets the code it’s getting and turns it into a webpage—in this case a search box with the Google logo (or maybe a Google doodle) above it.\r\n\r\n"

With Ajax, Web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows Web pages to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize JSON instead of XML due to the advantages of JSON being native to JavaScript.\r\n\r\n**2> [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX/Getting_Started](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX/Getting_Started)**\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with servers. It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and text files. AJAX’s most appealing characteristic is its \"asynchronous\" nature, which means it can communicate with the server, exchange data, and update the page without having to refresh the page.\r\n\r\nThe two major features of AJAX allow you to do the following:\r\n\r\n**Make requests to the server without reloading the page**\r\n**Receive and work with data from the server**"

This is especially useful for webpack bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation. You can either let the plugin generate an HTML file for you, supply your own template using lodash templates, or use your own loader.\r\n\r\n## Actual Implementation\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/rohan-paul/redux-boilerplate-base-counter/blob/master/redux-boilerplate-base-counter-AFTER-EJECTING/webpack.config.js#L8](https://github.com/rohan-paul/redux-boilerplate-base-counter/blob/master/redux-boilerplate-base-counter-AFTER-EJECTING/webpack.config.js#L8)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst HTMLWebpackPluginConfig = new HTMLWebpackPlugin({\r\n  template: path.join(__dirname, '/src/index.html'),\r\n  filename: 'index.html',\r\n  inject: 'body',\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2> https://medium.com/a-beginners-guide-for-webpack-2/index-html-using-html-webpack-plugin-85eabdb73474\r\n\r\nWe got webpack configured to package and bundle our js code in a single file -app.bundle.js, we need an index.html for our web app with a script tag havingsrc='app.bundle.js'. We have two options - either create it manually or have it created automatically by using ‘html-webpack-plugin’\r\n\r\nWhile creating index.html manually works good, it would be nice if webpack can create the index.html automatically for us with an included <script> tag with its src pointing to our app.bundle.js.\r\n\r\nWebpack can do this for us with the help of html-webpack-plugin. Using this plugin has some added advantages like auto-hashing the ‘src’ attribute of the embedded <script> tag every time the webpack is run, which makes browser to get the latest version of the file from server instead of using a cached one whenever it has a new hash.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn **create-react-app** - this module is used extensively, which I can see after ejecting\r\nThe below from ``./config/webpack.config.prod.js``\r\n```js\r\n// Generates an `index.html` file with the <script> injected.\r\n    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\r\n      inject: true,\r\n      template: paths.appHtml,\r\n      minify: {\r\n        removeComments: true,\r\n        collapseWhitespace: true,\r\n        removeRedundantAttributes: true,\r\n        useShortDoctype: true,\r\n        removeEmptyAttributes: true,\r\n        removeStyleLinkTypeAttributes: true,\r\n        keepClosingSlash: true,\r\n        minifyJS: true,\r\n        minifyCSS: true,\r\n        minifyURLs: true,\r\n      },\r\n    }),\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the below from ``./config/webpack.config.dev.js``\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Generates an `index.html` file with the <script> injected.\r\n    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\r\n      inject: true,\r\n      template: paths.appHtml,\r\n    }),\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Template: We are entering the path where our HTML file is located.\r\n\r\n### inject: it is optional actually what it does is Inject the script files inside the body tag.\r\n\r\n# Loaders\r\n\r\nWebpack accepts a loader object which specify loader to apply to files that match the test regex and exclude files that match the exclude regex. So, loaders let you run preprocessors on files as they’re imported. This allows you to bundle static resources beyond JavaScript, but let’s look at what can be done when loading .js modules first.  In this below case we’re applying the babel-loader to all files with a .js extension that aren’t in node_modules and are not in bower_components\r\n\r\nmodule: {\r\n     rules: [\r\n       {\r\n         test: /\\.js$/,\r\n         exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,\r\n         use: {\r\n           loader: 'babel-loader',\r\n         }\r\n       }\r\n     ]\r\n   }\r\n\r\n# Transformations like converting ES6 to ES5 with 'babel-loader'\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule: {\r\n        rules: [\r\n\r\n          {\r\n            test: /\\.(js|jsx)$/,\r\n            exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,\r\n            use:['babel-loader']\r\n\r\n          }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhat above code does is it checks if any file ends with .js/.jsx send that files to the babel-loader and apply transformations.\r\n\r\nLike we are using jsx but our browser doesn't understand jsx so that babel loader takes our jsx and converted it into javascript.\r\n\r\n# Different types of loaders- css-loader style-loader file-loader ,html-loader.\r\n\r\nWe can add more loaders in rules array\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule: {\r\n        rules: [\r\n\r\n          {\r\n            test: /\\.(js|jsx)$/,\r\n            exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,\r\n          use:['babel-loader']\r\n\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            test:/\\.css$/, use:[\r\n            { loader: MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader}\r\n              ,{loader:\"css-loader\",\r\n\r\n              options:{\r\n                minimize:true,\r\n                sourceMap:true\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n            ]\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            test: /\\.(html)$/,\r\n            use: {\r\n              loader: 'html-loader',\r\n              options: {\r\n                attrs: [':data-src'],\r\n                minimize:true\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            test: /\\.(png|jpg|gif|jpeg|ttf)$/,\r\n            use: [\r\n              {\r\n                loader: 'file-loader',\r\n                options: {\r\n                 name:'[path][name].[ext]',\r\n\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n**css-loader:** goes through possible @import and url() lookups within the matched files and creates source map for our CSS files, compress the css files by removing white spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# The understanding of the concept of externals in webpack.config.js - Noted while doing Countdown timer\r\n\r\nA) https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/laravel/using-webpack-with-externals\r\n\r\nI don't need a 1 MB .js file that needs to be recompiled and redownloaded every time I update my code which would otherwise be under 100k. Those jQuery, Bootstrap and other libraries are going to be cached by ISPs and, even when not, able to be pulled from much faster CDNs than trying to pull them from my system (plus they can be cached on the user side as well). From my understanding, instead of compiling the code of jQuery, etc into your app.js file, webpack could use externals to compile your stuff in the expectation that, even if $, _, and Vue aren't around now, they will be at runtime.\r\n\r\nB) https://www.toptal.com/javascript/a-guide-to-managing-webpack-dependencies\r\n\r\nConfiguring External Dependencies\r\nIf we want to include modules from externally hosted scripts, we need to define them in the configuration. Otherwise, Webpack cannot generate the final bundle.\r\n\r\nWe can configure external scripts by using the externals option in the Webpack configuration. For example, we can use a library from a CDN via a separate <script> tag, while still explicitly declaring it as a module dependency in our project.\r\n\r\nwebpack.config.js\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexternals: {\r\n   react: 'React',\r\n   'react-dom': 'ReactDOM'\r\n}\r\n```"
